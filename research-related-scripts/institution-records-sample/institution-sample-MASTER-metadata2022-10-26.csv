Although frequently asymptomatic, <i>C. trachomatis</i> infections in women cause genital inflammation. Given that genital inflammation increases womenâ€™s risk for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, treating and preventing chlamydia is vital. Thus, the development of a vaccine is paramount in controlling infection and spread.  Research into new drugs should also be pursued, especially with the rise of antimicrobial resistance. Although <i>C. trachomatis</i> microbiology has advanced with technology, the culture and detection of <i>C. trachomatis in vitro</i> remains challenging. The aim of this study was to establish a method to quantify laboratory adapted stocks of <i>C. trachomatis</i> in <i>in vitro</i> cell culture.</p><p>First, <i>C. trachomatis</i> serovars E, H, L1 and L2 were propagated in McCoy cells, using centrifugation using an established protocol. These stocks of unknown concentration were used to compare and optimise quantification methods using fluorescent microscopy. Three commercially available reagents were compared: (1) Pathfinderâ€™s <i>C. trachomatis </i>monoclonal antibody, (2) Invitrogenâ€™s <i>C. trachomatis </i>MOMP antibodies, and (3) Trinity Biotech MicroTrak <i>C. trachomatis </i>culture confirmation kit.</p><p>The Pathfinder <i>C. trachomatis </i>monoclonal antibody kit and Invitrogenâ€™s <i>C. trachomatis</i> MOMP Monoclonal Antibody kits both had poor sensitivity and gave high background fluorescent signals. Invitrogenâ€™s polyclonal antibody yielded inconsistent results, being either very weakly fluorescent or giving extremely bright signals. Thus, enumeration using this polyclonal antibody had limited success and results were not reproducible. MicroTrakâ€™s kit, in contrast, allowed for clear visualisation of inclusions and allowed for consistent and successful enumeration, although the  manufacturer has since taken the kit off the market.</p><p>In the research setting, fluorescent microscopy techniques are widely used for quantification of <i>C. trachomatis</i> due to their high sensitivity and inclusion bodies are easy to distinguish, even with an untrained eye. However, this study showed inconsistent and/or unreliable results from the available kits evaluated.  Although, rarely used in a research setting, future studies could explore qPCR-based methods to quantify <i>C. trachomatis</i> <i>in vitro.</i></p><p> </p><p> </p>",figure,['Medical virology'],"[{'item_id': 16866583, 'grant_title': 'MSC', 'funder_name': None, 'postDate': '2022-04-08T06:28:09'}]",1,0,6,Comparison Records,64,2022-04-08T06:28:09,1

The specimen is intended to deform in planar simple shear and is designed to be machined with a continuous annular shear zone. As a result, there are no â€œedge effectsâ€ or geometric discontinuities to generate instabilities, thus large true strains up to 1 can be achieved. Before this research, the specimen had only been used for material characterisation in the quasi-static regime. The aim of this research was to conduct further quasi-static testing using the in-plane torsion test and to extend its use into the dynamic regime. Quasi-static tests were performed on a quasi-static torsional (QST) system that was designed to be integrated onto a Zwick universal testing machine. Dynamic tests were performed on a modified torsional split Hopkinson bar (TSHB) system. The TSHB system adopted a nested configuration which allowed for a longer incident bar, and thus larger obtainable strains. Two quick-release mechanisms were used, one using a novel reusable wedge and the other using fracture-pins. All specimens were manufactured from Al 1050 H14. Typical results agreed with material test data available in the literature. Both systems attained large strains at near-constant strain rates and together, allowed for material characterisation over a large range of strain rates. Near-uniform deformations were observed for specimens with lower strain gauge widths. An added feature of the specimen was the flat reverse face, which together with the nested configuration of both systems allows for the possibility for full-field DIC measurement in the future. An estimation method for steady-state flow stress is presented with the steady-state flow stress found to be rate dependant. Finally, a relationship between the steady-state flow stress and strain rate for all experimental results is proposed.</div>",figure,['Mechanical engineering not elsewhere classified'],[],1,0,8,Comparison Records,87,2022-01-21T13:15:43,1

<p>On the Living With Data, we produced accounts and visualisations of six data uses. We asked survey respondents questions about data uses based on written accounts. We used the visualisations as elicitation tools in focus groups and interviews, accompanying them with verbal descriptions and discussions.Â </p>
<p>BBC and DWP data uses were selected by our contacts within these partner organisations. At the BBC, our focus was on two experiments with personal control over data:Â </p>
<ul>
  <li>BBC Box, a prototype which pulls together data about what users watch or listen to and gives them control over who has access to this data;Â </li>
  <li>BBC Own It, a free app designed by the BBC to support, help and advise children when they use their phones to chat and explore the online world, without adult supervision.</li>
</ul>
<p>DWP data uses both focused on ways of verifying identity online:Â </p>
<ul>
  <li>Confirm Your Identity, an identity verification process for Universal Credit payments which makes it possible to confirm identity online;Â </li>
  <li>Dynamic Trust Hub, which explored a range of issues to enhance identity verification, including technology integration and possible security checks.Â </li>
</ul>
<p>In the health domain, we produced accounts of:Â </p>
<ul>
  <li>The NHS Covid data store, a national data store to help organisations responsible for coordinating the Covid-19 response. We drew on information in the public domain, on government web pages and elsewhere to produce this account.Â </li>
  <li>Data uses in anNHS antibiotic prescribing research project<strong>.</strong> We drew on prior by Itzelle Medina-Perea to produce this account.Â </li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Organising data uses into themes</strong></h4>
<p>In our interviews and focus groups, we grouped data uses into four themes. The themes, our descriptions of them and the data uses included in the theme were:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Data Matching:</strong> this is where organisations match data from different datasets or databases, or compare data from one dataset with data from another. The Data Matching theme included the NHS antibiotic prescribing project and Confirm Your Identity.Â </li>
  <li><strong>Data Ownership and Control:</strong> who owns and controls data about you. The Data Ownership and Control theme included both BBC data uses, BBC Box and BBC Own It, and the NHS Covid-19 Data Store.</li>
  <li><strong>Data Sharing and Re-use:</strong> By this, we mean instances where data collected by one organisation is then shared with another organisation. The Data Sharing and Re-use theme included the two NHS data uses, the NHS antibiotic prescribing project and the NHS Covid-19 Data Store, and BBC Own It.Â Â Â Â Â </li>
  <li><strong>Algoritmic Processing:</strong> By algorithmic processing, we are referring to analytic processes where machines, not humans, make decisions, predictions or recommendations, for example about our behaviour or the kinds of content we see. The Algorithmic Processing theme included the two BBC data uses, BBC Box and BBC Own It, and DWP Dynamic Trust Hub.</li>

<p>Flow patterns and particle accumulation were visualised by tracking the motion of suspended particles through the model. As per the cell migration studies, the protocol detailed in this section was carried out for a variety of coronary and flow diverter stents, as well as empty non-stented vessels as controls. However, 1.5 mm diameter models were not included in this study.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>2.3.1 Set up</p>
<p>Vessels were connected to a fluid reservoir and peristaltic pump, as described in Section 2.2.5.1. Any models previously used with HUVEC were first cleaned of debris. Reservoirs were filled with 12 ml of room temperature 70% industrial methylated spirit (IMS). A suspension of 10 Âµm polystyrene particles (FluoSpheres, Fisher Scientific) with 3.6 x 106 particles/ml was agitated via vortex mixer (Lab Dancer S42, IKA). 40 Âµl of the suspension was then transferred to the reservoir at a 250:1 fluid to particle volume ratio. The pump was briefly set to maximum power, to circulate the fluid and distribute the particles around the system. The flow rate was then reduced to 6.5 ml/min for 2 mm diameter vessels, and 12.8 ml/min for 2.5 mm diameter vessels. At these rates, the Reynolds number was 43 and 68 respectively, matching that in blood flow of 1 Pa wall shear stress within the same model.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>2.3.2 Image acquisition</p>
<p>Model vessels were placed onto the stage of an inverted microscope (AE2000, Motic), with a connected camera (Moticam 2300, Motic). A 4x objective lens was used to ensure the full diameter of the vessel was in view and a live image was displayed via Images Plus software (Motic). The vessel was oriented so that the leading edge of the stent was within the image, with flow moving horizontally from left to right. The bottommost stent struts were brought into focus, before light intensity, aperture diaphragm opening and camera exposure were adjusted until moving particles could be seen.</p>
<p>The camera software was used to record a 2 minute video. The vessel was then repositioned so that the field of view was moved downstream, with a small amount of overlap with the previous field. Another 2 minute video was recorded and the vessel repositioned again. This process was repeated until the downstream end of the stent was captured in a final field of view.</p>
<p>Once the procedure was complete, particle accumulation was recorded (see Section 2.3.5). Following this, the model was flushed, removed from the system and rinsed with acetone to dissolve and remove any remaining particles. The model was rotated by 90Â° to expose different stent geometry and reconnected to the pump with a fresh reservoir. The above process was then repeated.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>2.3.3 Image processing</p>
<p>Video recordings were split into image sequences using Video to JPG Converter software (DVDVideoSoft). These images were, if required, reoriented to ensure that the direction of flow was exactly horizontal and that adjacent fields of view could be aligned. The software returned images at a frame rate of 20 frames per second (fps), and every second frame was selected. For each field of view two sets of 300 images, each representing roughly 30 seconds of flow, were selected for tracking.Â </p>
<p>One frame from each image sequence was used to isolate the struts by removing the PDMS wall, along with any attached particles or debris, providing a clear image of stent geometry onto which tracks could be overlaid.</p>",figure,['Cardiovascular medicine and haematology not elsewhere classified'],"[{'item_id': 19803667, 'grant_title': 'EPSRC', 'funder_name': None, 'postDate': '2022-05-25T13:53:56'}, {'item_id': 19803667, 'grant_title': 'Wellcome Trust', 'funder_name': None, 'postDate': '2022-05-25T13:53:56'}, {'item_id': 19803667, 'grant_title': 'British Heart Foundation', 'funder_name': None, 'postDate': '2022-05-25T13:53:56'}]",1,0,1,Comparison Records,168,2022-05-25T13:53:56,1

<p>Flow patterns and particle accumulation were visualised by tracking the motion of suspended particles through the model. As per the cell migration studies, the protocol detailed in this section was carried out for a variety of coronary and flow diverter stents, as well as empty non-stented vessels as controls. However, 1.5 mm diameter models were not included in this study.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>2.3.1 Set up</p>
<p>Vessels were connected to a fluid reservoir and peristaltic pump, as described in Section 2.2.5.1. Any models previously used with HUVEC were first cleaned of debris. Reservoirs were filled with 12 ml of room temperature 70% industrial methylated spirit (IMS). A suspension of 10 Âµm polystyrene particles (FluoSpheres, Fisher Scientific) with 3.6 x 106 particles/ml was agitated via vortex mixer (Lab Dancer S42, IKA). 40 Âµl of the suspension was then transferred to the reservoir at a 250:1 fluid to particle volume ratio. The pump was briefly set to maximum power, to circulate the fluid and distribute the particles around the system. The flow rate was then reduced to 6.5 ml/min for 2 mm diameter vessels, and 12.8 ml/min for 2.5 mm diameter vessels. At these rates, the Reynolds number was 43 and 68 respectively, matching that in blood flow of 1 Pa wall shear stress within the same model.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>2.3.2 Image acquisition</p>
<p>Model vessels were placed onto the stage of an inverted microscope (AE2000, Motic), with a connected camera (Moticam 2300, Motic). A 4x objective lens was used to ensure the full diameter of the vessel was in view and a live image was displayed via Images Plus software (Motic). The vessel was oriented so that the leading edge of the stent was within the image, with flow moving horizontally from left to right. The bottommost stent struts were brought into focus, before light intensity, aperture diaphragm opening and camera exposure were adjusted until moving particles could be seen.</p>
<p>The camera software was used to record a 2 minute video. The vessel was then repositioned so that the field of view was moved downstream, with a small amount of overlap with the previous field. Another 2 minute video was recorded and the vessel repositioned again. This process was repeated until the downstream end of the stent was captured in a final field of view.Â </p>
<p>Once the procedure was complete, particle accumulation was recorded (see Section 2.3.5). Following this, the model was flushed, removed from the system and rinsed with acetone to dissolve and remove any remaining particles. The model was rotated by 90Â° to expose different stent geometry and reconnected to the pump with a fresh reservoir. The above process was then repeated.</p>

<p>Flow patterns and particle accumulation were visualised by tracking the motion of suspended particles through the model. As per the cell migration studies, the protocol detailed in this section was carried out for a variety of coronary and flow diverter stents, as well as empty non-stented vessels as controls. However, 1.5 mm diameter models were not included in this study.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>2.3.1 Set up</p>
<p>Vessels were connected to a fluid reservoir and peristaltic pump, as described in Section 2.2.5.1. Any models previously used with HUVEC were first cleaned of debris. Reservoirs were filled with 12 ml of room temperature 70% industrial methylated spirit (IMS). A suspension of 10 Âµm polystyrene particles (FluoSpheres, Fisher Scientific) with 3.6 x 106 particles/ml was agitated via vortex mixer (Lab Dancer S42, IKA). 40 Âµl of the suspension was then transferred to the reservoir at a 250:1 fluid to particle volume ratio. The pump was briefly set to maximum power, to circulate the fluid and distribute the particles around the system. The flow rate was then reduced to 6.5 ml/min for 2 mm diameter vessels, and 12.8 ml/min for 2.5 mm diameter vessels. At these rates, the Reynolds number was 43 and 68 respectively, matching that in blood flow of 1 Pa wall shear stress within the same model.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>2.3.2 Image acquisition</p>
<p>Model vessels were placed onto the stage of an inverted microscope (AE2000, Motic), with a connected camera (Moticam 2300, Motic). A 4x objective lens was used to ensure the full diameter of the vessel was in view and a live image was displayed via Images Plus software (Motic). The vessel was oriented so that the leading edge of the stent was within the image, with flow moving horizontally from left to right. The bottommost stent struts were brought into focus, before light intensity, aperture diaphragm opening and camera exposure were adjusted until moving particles could be seen.</p>
<p>The camera software was used to record a 2 minute video. The vessel was then repositioned so that the field of view was moved downstream, with a small amount of overlap with the previous field. Another 2 minute video was recorded and the vessel repositioned again. This process was repeated until the downstream end of the stent was captured in a final field of view.</p>
<p>Once the procedure was complete, particle accumulation was recorded (see Section 2.3.5). Following this, the model was flushed, removed from the system and rinsed with acetone to dissolve and remove any remaining particles. The model was rotated by 90Â° to expose different stent geometry and reconnected to the pump with a fresh reservoir. The above process was then repeated.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>2.3.3 Image processing</p>
<p>Video recordings were split into image sequences using Video to JPG Converter software (DVDVideoSoft). These images were, if required, reoriented to ensure that the direction of flow was exactly horizontal and that adjacent fields of view could be aligned. The software returned images at a frame rate of 20 frames per second (fps), and every second frame was selected. For each field of view two sets of 300 images, each representing roughly 30 seconds of flow, were selected for tracking.</p>

wavelength of 1.70 Î¼m at room temperature and a responsivity of 0.39 A/W at
1.55 Î¼m wavelength (no antireflection coating). Temperature dependence of the
breakdown voltage was obtained from avalanche gain data from multiple devices
operated at 77 to 295 K. This produced a temperature coefficient of breakdown
voltage of 4.31Â±0.33 mV/K, a factor of 10 and 5 smaller than values for
comparable InP and InAlAs SAM-APDs. The very small temperature coefficient of

Each country's colour reflects the average Implicit Association Test (IAT) score for that country using data from Harvard's Project Implicit. Overall we have scores for 288,076 White Europeans, collected between 2002 and 2015, with sample sizes for each country shown inset.<br><br>The IAT<br>The IAT is a measure of implicit racial attitudes. Because of the design of the test it is very difficult to deliberately control your score . Many people, including those who sincerely hold non-racist or even anti-racist beliefs, demonstrate positive implicit bias on the test. Scores on the test are not reliable, and so don't allow predictions of individuals' true implicit attitudes or behaviour. However, when many scores are collected together definite patterns emerge. The most striking of these is that the average score on the racial bias IAT is non-zero. Both in the US, where this measure was developed, across Europe (shown here for the first time), the test shows that people are slower to associate Blackness with positive words such as ""Good"" or ""Nice"" and faster to associate Blackness with negative concepts such as ""Bad"" or ""Evil"". <br><br>One idea is that implicit attitudes, such as measured by the IAT, reflect the automatic associations we hold in our minds, and that these develop over years of immersion in the social world. Although we, as individuals, may not hold racist beliefs, the ideas we associate with race may be constructed by a culture which describes people of different ethnicities in consistent ways, and ways which are consistently more or less positive. Looked at like this, the IAT - which is a weak measure of individual psychology - may be most useful if individuals' scores are aggregated to provide a reflection on the collective social world we inhabit.<br><br>The results shown in this map give detail to what we already expected - that across Europe racial attitudes are not neutral. Blackness has negative associations for White Europeans, and there are some interesting patterns in how the strength of these negative associations vary across the continent.<br><br><br><br>*open data, open tools*<br>This new map is possible because Project Implicit release their data via the Open Science Framework (<a href=""https://osf.io/52qxl/"">osf.io</a>). This site allows scientists to share the raw materials and data from their experiments, allowing anyone to check their working, or re-analyse the data (as we have done here). The data analysis and map were done in R, an open source statistical programming language, and we collaborated using github.com, a platform for software projects. Now the data and code to produce the map are shared on Figshare.com, a site which allows data and graphics to be given stable digital object indentifiers (DOIs) and so integrated into the scholarly literature like other publications. We believe that open tools and publishing methods like these are necessary to make science better and more reliable.<br><br>*Sample limitations*<br>The data comes from Europeans who visited the US Project Implicit website, which is in English. Language specific IAT data may be available in the near future. For now we can be certain that the sample reflects a subset of the European population which are more internet-savvy than typical, probably younger, and probably more cosmopolitan (both because they are both comfortable using a website in English, and from the sheer fact that they were interested in taking a test of implicit racism). These factors are likely to underweight the extent of implicit racism in each country.<br><br>This data reflects scores on just one IAT (the classic White-Black/Positive-Negative IAT). Other dimensions of social attitudes can be assessed by different IATs.

My interest in music listening statistics is largely inspired by Spotify's end-of-the-year review ""Spotify Wrapped"", as well as community-created apps that analyze and visualize listening data using Spotify's API. I was able to gain access to my listening data through Spotify, who will allow you to download a year's worth of your listening and account data upon request.</p>
<p>The circular barplot serves as a 24 hour clock, where each bar represents how many plays were recorded in that hour of the day. The charts are then split into quarters for morning, afternoon, evening, and night, mimicking daylight and night sky. These were created as histograms and were made circular using coord_polar(). The x and y axes were then modified to create the hole in the center.</p>
<p>The visual is faceted to show three unique dataframes: my entire listening history for that timeframe, my listening history of Fall Out Boy, and my listening history of 100 gecs. These were chosen to dissect my listening behavior at particular moments in my life.Â </p>
<p>I listen to Fall Out Boy primarily while traveling to and from Phoenix, and I listen to 100 gecs mostly while studying or coding. With this, I was able to recognize some of my habits in my barplots; my listening of Fall Out Boy was highest at 4-5AM and 8PM, which is usually when I would take long commutes. My listening of 100 gecs was highest at 7PM and 2AM, indicative of my night-owl studying habits.</p>
<p>Because of this challenge, I learned to familiarize myself with new R packages, as well as how circular barplots can be created using R Studio. Overall, it was a lot of fun and I'm excited to continue working with music and listening data in the future!</p>

cells, contributes to the regeneration of the epithelium.  The recruitment of macrophages plays a central
role in the regenerative process.  The
mechanism that regulates macrophage recruitment in response to gastric injury
is largely unknown.  Here we tested the
hypothesis that<b> </b>Shh stimulates macrophage chemotaxis to the
injured epithelium and contributes to gastric regeneration.  A mouse model expressing a myeloid
cell-specific deletion of Smoothened (LysMcre/+;Smof/f) was generated using
transgenic mice bearing loxP sites flanking the Smo gene (Smo loxP) and mice
expressing a Cre recombinase transgene from the Lysozyme M locus
(LysMCre).  Acetic acid injury was
induced in the stomachs of both control and LysMcre/+;Smof/f (SmoKO) mice
and gastric epithelial regeneration and macrophage recruitment analyzed over a
period of 7 days post-injury. Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BM-MÃ¸) were
collected from control and SmoKO mice. Human-derived gastric
organoid/macrophage co-cultures were established, and macrophage chemotaxis
measured.  Compared to control mice, SmoKO
animals exhibited inhibition of ulcer repair and normal epithelial
regeneration, that correlated with decreased macrophage infiltration at the
site of injury.  Bone
marrow chimera experiments using SmoKO donor cells showed that control chimera
mice transplanted with SmoKO bone marrow donor cells exhibited a loss of ulcer
repair, and transplantation of control bone marrow donor cells to SmoKO mice
rescued epithelial cell regeneration.  Histamine
stimulated Shh secretion in human organoid/macrophage co-cultures resulted in macrophage
migration toward the gastric epithelium, a response that was blocked with Smo inhibitor
Vismodegib.  Shh-induced macrophage
migration was mediated by AKT signaling.<b> </b>In conclusion, Shh signaling acts as a macrophage chemoattractant via a
Smo-dependent mechanism during gastric epithelial regeneration in response to
injury.<div><div><br></div><div><hr></div><div><br></div><div><i>For inquiries regarding the contents of this dataset, please contact the Corresponding Author listed in the README.txt file.

We examined a predator-prey interaction between native bees and their woodpecker predators that may be altered by the beesâ€™ nest plant. In southeastern Arizona, carpenter bees build nests inside dried inflorescence stalks of plants such as sotol. Woodpeckers prey upon carpenter bee larvae inside these stalks, but sotolâ€™s dense rosette of barbed leaves may protect larvae. We hypothesized that nests surrounded by leaves would be less accessible to woodpeckers, increasing predation on higher nests. This could drive nest placement. To test this hypothesis, we recorded locations of nests, rosettes, and predation.</div><div><div><br></div><div><hr></div><div><br></div><div><i>For inquiries regarding the contents of this dataset, please contact the Corresponding Author listed in the README.txt file.

As most patients present with advanced disease, the majority are managed solely through palliative chemotherapy. While select chemotherapies improve overall survival, nearly all patients will eventually progress on treatment. In our recent study, we determined that long-term chemotherapy leads to significant changes to the immunogenicity of pancreatic tumors, and sensitizes mice to multi-drug immunotherapy. In the corresponding image, we show tumor tissue of a mouse treated with a combination of chemo and immunotherapy stained by immunofluorescence. Specifically, tissues have been stained for Cytokeratin 19 (Green), a duct marker that will react with cancer cells, and Granzyme B (Red), a marker of cells being destroyed by the immune system.

Over the past few decades, researchers have come up with innovative strategies by tapping into this deluge of ambient moisture resource in an attempt to provide the world with â€˜drinkable airâ€™. However, most of these water-from-air devices suffer from the practical challenges of energy efficiency and durability. Motivated by this, we have developed a coating material for mining moisture from air in climates ranging from foggy to humid and that is what the current image (captured as a part of my ongoing doctoral research at UIC) intends to convey. To demonstrate this, I have carried out experiments in a simulated humid environment by cooling a hydrophilic textured surface coated with a naturally-derived waxy material. Stripped from air, water droplets show very low adhesion and effortlessly roll down the sub-cooled coated surface, thereby harvesting water. The locking of the waxy material within the surface features of the underlying solid substrate prevents its out-of-texture depletion by water and provides a â€˜coolâ€™ solution to quench the thirsty world.",figure,['Mechanical Engineering'],"[{'item_id': 16754839, 'grant_title': 'This exhibit competition is organized by the University of Illinois at Chicago Graduate College and the University Library.', 'funder_name': None, 'postDate': '2021-10-06T21:59:43'}]",1,0,3,Comparison Records,126,2021-10-06T21:59:43,1

For the past 35 years, biologists have been working to reestablish self-sustaining wild populations with management and breeding efforts. However, full recovery of the species has yet to be reached due to disease, limited habitat, and a declining fertility trend in the breeding program. My research explores how the ferretâ€™s fertility and reproductive success can be improved naturally, by reinstating the behavior of mate choice into conservation breeding. Male and females explored a â€œYâ€ maze with olfactory cues from two opposite sex potential mates at either end. We predicted scent (i.e. feces, urine, pheromones) would contain the necessary information about health and compatibility an individual would need to determine mate quality. In addition to knowing which mate was preferred, we examined olfactory cues, hormones (stress and reproductive), gut health, and genetic profiles to see what constituted a quality mate.

This instrument measures a sampleâ€™s electromagnetic absorption in the ultraviolet or visible ranges. More simply, this instrument quantifies color.

Each forensic discipline endorses testimonial verbiage vetted by their particular consensus standards. For example, Questioned Documents currently abides by conclusion terminology standards developed by the Scientific Working Group for Forensic Document Examination (SWGDOC). In contrast, Latent Fingerprints adheres to consensus body standards vetted by their own separate entity. With each discipline using different terminology in court, jurors can easily be confused about the relative importance of the evidence presented.

To be brief, the trays that have the least leftover food reflect conditions that are preferred by the seed predators (i.e., they like that sort of forest). It is through the use of camera traps that I was able to determine that these rodents are present in our experiment and that they are the primary seed predators. Through this research project I was also able to show that forest patches that lack canopy cover but are overrun by invasive ferns (observed in photo) are more likely to have these rodents, as indicated by how much seed they consumed from trays in those locations.

When light strikes a thin surface with thickness smaller than the wavelength of light, the reflected light waves from upper and lower boundaries of the surface can reinforce each other, giving rise to an intensified color depending on the surfaceâ€™s thickness. A thin aqueous film with a varied thickness or curvature-like bubble can lead to the formation of colorful patterns. Based on the same mechanism, an oil spill on water exhibits fringes due to its uneven thickness and different refractive indexes compared to water and air. In recent years, a large number of studies have been focused on removing oil spills due to their damage to the ecosystem. Having detailed information about the evolution and dynamics of oil droplets at the water-air interface by the presence of active molecules enables experts to propose better strategies to these efforts. The presence of surface-active agents promote the spreading of oil and increase the frequency of coalescence events between them, leading to faster formation of oil films.

Glove penetration is defined as a contaminant entering the glove via splash-back over the glove cuff and/or tearing, puncture, or abrasion of the glove material. To do so, I devised a simple dish-washing simulation during which participants put on nitrile gloves and washed laboratory glassware for 10 minutes using a fluorescein solution contained in a large plastic tub. Following the simulation, gloves were removed and the hands were analyzed for dermal exposure (i.e. fluorescein solution on the hands), which entailed using a fluorometer to determine the mass of dermal contamination and black light image analysis to determine the surface area of contamination. The fluorescein solution fluoresces under black light (as shown in this photographic image), allowing me to then use Adobe Photoshop to determine the surface area of fluorescein contamination on the hands.

The most useful information in a visual scene is contained in patterns of contrast. Our retina creates receptive fields as an adaptation for detecting this useful information in order to craft our visual experience. I have set out to explore the molecular and cellular mechanisms that modulate our visual signal in the outer vertebrate retina in order to process contrast. A light stimulus starts a signaling process in the photoreceptors and ultimately leads to visual information being sent to the brain for higher processing via the optic nerve. During this time, the signal initiated by the light stimulus undergoes a myriad of modifications by interneurons in order to â€œfinely tuneâ€ the visual signal through a series of both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic connections.

<p>Fundamentally guided by Michel-Rolph Trouillotâ€™s (1995) rationale on history-making, the methodology entailed merging the artistic knowledge produced on the rehearsal floor with the digital humanities practices of ensuring that the data produced is in accordance with the F.A.I.R (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) principles. The digital datasets that have been captured to date are part of an ever-expanding, living archive, with the flexibility of the digital space allowing for the potential to decentre the notion of the archivist as a singular entity and distribute it amongst a community of digital citizens. The aim of producing and expanding on such a rich source of comprehensive datasets is the hope for broadening the possibility for critical engagement and interrogation across the Humanities, to further academic research. Additionally, ReTAGS aims to set precedent for expansive possibilities of using performance practice-based research in producing and publishing academically rigorous data.</p>
<p>This paper reflects on my involvement as the digital archivist on the ReTAGS research and my choices made and implemented on the online showcase repository. Considering the strengths and challenges of these archival choices; exploring the possibilities and inviting discussion around archiving for artistic purposes as well as understanding the archive as its own means of artistic engagement.</p>

<p>The Australian Museum acquired three cartonnage masks and a foot-case in the early 20th century. The cartonnage pieces have been recently restored and they are ready for display.</p>
<p>Quite fragile compared to wooden coffins or stone sarcophagi, many cartonnage masks survived surprisingly well preserved for some millennia. They proliferated in the Greco-Roman period of Egyptian history and hundreds were recovered from ancient cemeteries. Relatively little research was completed on these funerary accessories but in recent times scholars have begun to show more interest, as is attested by a study conducted by Dr. Carlo Rindi Nuzzolo who examined our masks in April 2022.</p>
<p>Cartonnage (cardboard) - a word derived from French â€“ describes a material made of layers of linen or papyrus covered with plaster and used in ancient Egyptian funerary masks and full-body casing from the First Intermediate Period (c. 2181â€“2055 BCE) to the Roman era (332 BC -395 AD).</p>

<p>Description and abstracts:</p>
<p>Co-produced research opens up the research process to involve research participants themselves in identifying research questions and planning studies. Join <a href=""https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/education/people/academic/dan-goodley"" target=""_blank"">Dan Goodley</a> (iHuman and School of Education), <a href=""https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/politics/people/academic-staff/matthew-flinders"" target=""_blank"">Matt Flinders</a> (Department of Politics) and the University of Sheffield Library for a discussion of the challenges, possibilities and power dynamics of co-produced research.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Flinders, Department of Politics</strong></p>
<p>Co-production and co-design have emerged as central principles within the emergent research funding landscape. While generally welcoming this shift towards working across traditional professional, intellectual and organisational boundaries, Matt Flinders raises a set of concerns regarding deference and decline, co-option and control. Â His core argument is that 'unthinking' co-production raises a host of political questions about boundaries, relationships and the contamination of research as scholars, practitioners and publics risk becoming trapped in a Faustian bargain.</p>
<p><strong>Dan Goodley, iHuman and School of Education:</strong> Co-production with researchers with learning disabilitiesÂ </p>
<p>In this talk Dan will share some reflections on working with researchers with learning disabilities (including people who also identify as autistic) on a new ESRC funded project entitled Humanising Healthcare. Dan will discuss the challenges and possibilities of co-production including seeking and obtaining funding, responding to reviewers' comments, working with diverse researchers, collaborating across the social sciences and medicine, developing online methods, driving methodological innovation and co-researchers as research managers and theoretical provocateurs.Â </p>

We present a novel control strategy for solving this problemâ€” the first to be free of arithmetic computation. The agents do not communicate with each other nor do they store run-time information. They have a line-of-sight sensor that extracts one ternary digit of information from the environment. At every time step, they directly map this information onto constant-value motor commands. We evaluate the control strategy with both simulated and physical e-puck robots. By default, the robots are expected to choose, and move to, one of two options of equal value. The simulation studies show that the strategy is robust against sensory noise, scalable to large swarm sizes, and generalizes to the problems of choosing between more than two options or between unequal options. The experimentsâ€”50 trials conducted with a group of 20 e-puck robotsâ€”show that the group achieves consensus in 96% of the trials. Given the extremely low hardware requirements of the strategy, it opens up new possibilities for the design of swarms of robots that are small in size (â‰ª 10<sup>âˆ’3</sup> m) and large in numbers (â‰« 10<sup>3</sup>).</div>",media,"['Control engineering, mechatronics and robotics not elsewhere classified', 'Intelligent robotics']",[],2,2,7,Comparison Records,527,2019-10-24T14:56:39,1

In the present work, we address the shepherding problem, where the computation- and memory-free agentsâ€”the shepherdsâ€”are tasked to gather and move a group of dynamic agentsâ€”the sheepâ€”towards a pre-defined goal. The shepherds and sheep are modelled as e-puck robots using computer simulations. Our findings show that the shepherding problem does not fundamentally require arithmetic computation or memory to be solved.

The novelty of our proposed solution is that it is applicable to extremely simple robots that lack run-time computation or storage. The solution requires only a single bit of information per robotâ€”whether or not another robot is present in its line of sight. Computer simulations show that our deterministic controller, which was obtained through off-line optimization, achieves around 71â€“76% coverage in a test scenario with no robot redundancy, which corresponds to a 26â€“39% reduction of the area that is not covered, when compared to an optimized random walk. A moderately lower level of performance was observed in 20 experimental trials with 25 physical e-puck robots. Moreover, we demonstrate that the same controller can be used in environments of different dimensions and even to navigate a maze. The controller provides a baseline against which one can quantify the performance improvements that more advanced and expensive techniques may offer. Moreover, due to its simplicity, it could potentially be implemented on swarms of sub-millimeter-sized robots. This would pave the way for new applications in micro-medicine.</div>",media,"['Control engineering, mechatronics and robotics not elsewhere classified', 'Intelligent robotics']",[],2,2,7,Comparison Records,495,2019-10-19T11:40:22,1

However, if the surface temperature is significantly higher than the boiling point, the evaporation rate of the liquid drop becomes high enough that it creates a vapor cushion below the droplet preventing any contact between the liquid and the substrate. This phenomenon, known as Leidenfrost effect, represents a very low rate of heat transfer from the hot surface. During my research at UIC, Iâ€™ve studied the behavior of individual droplets after contacting superheated microstructured surfaces. With the goal of understanding and recognizing the dominant heat transfer mechanisms during the droplet impact, Iâ€™ve fabricated microstructures to systematically study the boiling transitions inside an impacting liquid droplet. This video is explaining a very interesting incident at which the droplet shows an explosion behavior after it contacts a substrate with a dense pattern of fabricated microstructures. During this explosion, even though the droplet shows a similar behavior to when it boils, boiling is suppressed, and the explosion is not a sign of efficient heat transfer. Recognizing this behavior is vital to avoid any possible calamities in power plants and industries in which cooling hot surfaces is critical.<br>",media,['Mechanical Engineering'],"[{'item_id': 16752502, 'grant_title': 'This exhibit competition is organized by the University of Illinois at Chicago Graduate College and the University Library.', 'funder_name': None, 'postDate': '2021-10-06T16:17:30'}]",1,0,3,Comparison Records,76,2021-10-06T16:17:30,1

The RSNA recording technique is compatible with pharmacologic, optogenetic, or electrical stimulation of the CNS. The approach is useful when an investigator will measure short-term (min to h) autonomic responses in non-survival experiments to correlate anatomically with CNS nuclei. The approach is not intended to be used to obtain chronic (survival) recordings of RSNA in rats.

Using Ivlevâ€™s electivity indices (Ei), we show that Southern Pied Babblers preferentially nest (Ei = 0.18) and forage (Ei = 0.24) in camelthorn trees. Southern Pied Babblers primarily forage on the ground, however they will make use of arboreal resource when these are available. We observed the birds spending the highest proportion of foraging time off the ground during October, when breeding is also most common, compared to all other months within the austral summer breeding season. They are most likely to be observed in camelthorn trees earlier compared to later in the breeding season.We demonstrate that Southern Pied Babblers have a strong relationship with camelthorn trees, in which they prefer to nest and forage. We highlight the importance of protecting camelthorn trees, a keystone species in the region, as part of the conservation and management of endemic Kalahari fauna such as the Southern Pied Babbler. In addition to contributing to the literature on keystone species, our observations raise interesting questions about the ways in which avian reproduction in the arid zone could be decoupled from rainfall via the phenology of deep-rooted tree species.

This sensory capability allows them to locate their prey using highâ€frequency vibrations in the substrate in the absence of other sensory cues. Remoteâ€touch is facilitated by a specialised billâ€tip organ, comprising high densities of mechanoreceptors (Herbst corpuscles) embedded in numerous foramina in the beak bones. Each foramen and its associated Herbst corpuscles make up a sensory unit, called a â€˜sensory pitâ€™. These sensory pits are densely clustered in the distal portion of the beak. Previous research has indicated that interspecific differences in the extent of sensory pitting in the beak bones correlate with aquatic habitat use of ibises, and have been suggested to reflect different levels of remoteâ€touch sensitivity. Our study investigates the interspecific differences in the bone and soft tissue histology of the billâ€tip organs of three species of southern African ibises from different habitats (mainly terrestrial to mainly aquatic). We analysed the external pitting pattern on the bones, as well as internal structure of the beak using microâ€CT scans and soft tissue histological sections of each species' billâ€tip organs. The beaks of all three species contain remoteâ€touch billâ€tip organs and are described here in detail. Clear interspecific differences are evident between the species' billâ€tip organs, both in terms of bone morphology and soft tissue histology. Glossy Ibises, which forage exclusively in wetter substrates, have a greater extent of pitting but lower numbers of Herbst corpuscles in each pit, while species foraging in drier substrates (Hadeda and Sacred Ibises) have more robust beaks, fewer pits and higher densities of Herbst corpuscles. Our data, together with previously published histological descriptions of the billâ€tip organs of other remoteâ€touch foraging bird species, indicate that species foraging in drier habitats have more sensitive billâ€tip organs (based on their anatomy). The vibrations produced by prey (e.g., burrowing invertebrates) travel poorly in dry substrates compared with wetter ones (i.e., dry soil vs. mud or water), and thus we hypothesise that a more sensitive billâ€tip organ may be required to successfully locate prey in dry substrates. Furthermore, our results indicate that the differences in billâ€tip organ anatomy between the species reflect complex tradeâ€offs between morphological constraints of beak shape and remoteâ€touch sensitivity requirements, both of which are likely related to each species' foraging behaviour and substrate usage. Our study suggests that structures in the bone of the billâ€tip organ could provide valuable osteological correlates for the associated soft tissues, and consequently may provide information on the sensory ecology and habitat usage of the birds in theÂ absence of soft tissues. This study describes interspecific differences in the anatomy of the remoteâ€touch billâ€tip organ in ibises which correlate with the birds' foraging habitats. Our results indicate that species foraging in drier substrates have more sensitive billâ€tip organs, and that several structures in the beak bones may be valuable osteological correlates for the associated soft tissues and consequently for the birds' foraging behaviour and sensory ecology.Â </p>",dataset,"['Animal behaviour', 'Animal structure and function', 'Vertebrate biology']","[{'item_id': 20411640, 'grant_title': 'DSIâ€NRF Centre of Excellence at the FitzPatrick Institute of African Ornithology', 'funder_name': None, 'postDate': '2022-08-01T14:09:04'}, {'item_id': 20411640, 'grant_title': 'DSIâ€NRF Centre of Excellence in Palaeosciences', 'funder_name': None, 'postDate': '2022-08-01T14:09:04'}, {'item_id': 20411640, 'grant_title': 'National Research Foundation', 'funder_name': None, 'postDate': '2022-08-01T14:09:04'}]",3,0,10,Comparison Records,83,2022-08-01T14:09:04,1

<p><strong>Aims: </strong>We investigate the spatiotemporal distribution, movement patterns and growth rates of <em>Carcharhinus brachyurus</em> in southern Africa.Â </p>
<p><strong>Methods: </strong>We analysed a 36-year cooperative shore-angling tag-recapture dataset.</p>
<p><strong>Key results:</strong> Distribution was centred in Namibia and the South Coast of South Africa during the austral summer. Large-scale regional movement of individual sharks (<em>n</em> = 21) supports the lack of population structure in southern African. The South Coast of South Africa represented a potentially important nursery region where 96% of all juveniles were tagged. Sub-adults and adults were more widely distributed and recorded significantly greater time at liberty than juveniles, but the distance moved for adults was significantly lower, indicating higher site fidelity. Growth model predictions showed annual growth rates of <em>C. brachyurus</em> were among the slowest when compared to other carcharhinids.</p>

Developing a model that accounts for both factors will improve our understanding of the coagulation process. The work presented in this study details the development of a CFD model that considers the biochemical reactions between thrombin and fibrinogen, pulsatile blood flow, and clot growth within a three-dimensional patient-specific common femoral vein. Thrombin is released into the bloodstream from an injury zone on the wall of the vein. The Michaelis-Menten equation is used to represent the conversion of thrombin and fibrinogen to fibrin, the final product of the coagulation process. The model development began in a two-dimensional idealized geometry. At this stage, the model is used to conduct a parametric study to determine the effects of varying parameters such as inlet velocity, vein diameter, and peak thrombin concentration on the size and shape of the clot formed. Peak thrombin concentration is the key factor driving the initiation and propagation of clots in the vein. To demonstrate the potential use of the model, the two-dimensional model is then extended to an image-derived three-dimensional patient-specific geometry. Realistic clot growth was achieved using this model, and the clot was compared to a clot formed in vivo, demonstrating that with further development and refinement, this model could be used for patient-specific interventional planning.",dataset,['Biomedical engineering not elsewhere classified'],[],1,0,8,Comparison Records,305,2022-04-04T07:15:18,2

<p><br></p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has forced individuals to adopt online applications and technologies, as well as remote working patterns. Â However, with changes in technology and working patterns, new Â vulnerabilities are likely to arise. Cybersecurity threats have rapidly evolved to exploit uncertainty during the pandemic, and users need to apply careful judgment and vigilance to avoid becoming the victim of a Â cyber-attack. This paper explores the factors that motivate security Â behaviour, considering the current environmental uncertainty. An adapted Â model, primarily based on the Protection Motivation Theory (PMT), is Â proposed and evaluated using data collected from an online survey of 222 Â respondents from a Higher Education institution. Data analysis was Â performed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling Â (PLS-SEM). The results confirm the applicability of PMT in the security Â context. Respondentsâ€™ behavioural intention, perceived threat Â vulnerability, response cost, response efficacy, security habits, and Â subjective norm predicted self-reported security behaviour. In contrast, Â environmental uncertainty, attitude towards policy compliance, Â self-efficacy and perceived threat severity did not significantly impact Â behavioural intention. The results show that respondents were able to Â cope with environmental uncertainty and maintain security behaviour.</p>",dataset,"['Information systems not elsewhere classified', 'Other commerce, management, tourism and services not elsewhere classified']",[],2,0,7,Comparison Records,184,2022-04-19T12:42:08,1

distribution of animals in a landscape depends mainly on the distribution of resources.
Resource availability is often facilitated by other species and can positively
influence local species diversity and affect community structure. Species that
significantly change resource availability are often termed, ecosystem
engineers. Identifying these species is important but predicting where they
have large or small impacts is a key challenge that will enhance the usefulness
of the ecosystem engineering concept. In harsh and stressful environments, the stress
gradient hypothesis predicts that community structure and function will be increasingly
influenced by facilitative interactions. To test this hypothesis, we investigate how
the ecosystem engineering role and importance of sociable weavers <i>Philetairus
socius</i> varies across a spatial gradient of harshness, for which aridity
served as a proxy. These birds build large colonies that are home to hundreds
of weavers and host a wide range of avian and non-avian heterospecifics. We
investigated the use of weaver colonies on multiple taxa (invertebrates,
reptiles, birds, and mammals) at multiple sites across a >1000 km aridity gradient.
We show that sociable weaver colonies create localized biodiversity hots-spots across
their range. Furthermore, trees containing sociable weaver colonies maintained localized
animal diversity at sites with lower rainfall, an effect not as pronounced at sites
with higher rainfall. Our results were consistent with predictions of the stress
gradient hypothesis, and we provide one of the first tests of this hypothesis in
terrestrial animal communities. Facilitation and amelioration by ecosystem engineers

based on the attraction to other species can be used as a defence strategy. This
attraction can provide valuable social information and protection benefits. Increased shared vigilance or cooperative mobbing can
come from small birds, while raptors may provide a protective umbrella against
brood parasites. The common redstart (<i>Phoenicurus phoenicurus</i>) is part of the migrant bird community and
is a regular host for the common cuckoo (<i>Cuculus
canorus</i>). We placed redstart
nest-boxes near to active nests of great tit (<i>Parus
major</i>), and at different distances from  active goshawk (<i>Accipiter
gentilis</i>) nests. We
monitored occupancy rates and followed
nest outcomes in terms of brood parasitism and nest predation risk, while
following other breeding factors that could be affected (e.g. breeding onset, reproductive
investment, and reproductive success). We found that redstarts avoided breeding near to goshawks, but they showed neither attraction nor avoidance
to breed next to great tits. Heterospecific
neighbours neither reduced brood parasitism risk nor affected overall nesting
success in redstarts. Thus, redstarts may not benefit from breeding near
heterospecifics. Other front-line strategies may be more important for
redstarts to prevent brood parasitism.  </p>",dataset,"['Animal behaviour', 'Animal developmental and reproductive biology', 'Behavioural ecology', 'Biological adaptation', 'Community ecology (excl. invasive species ecology)', 'Zoology not elsewhere classified']","[{'item_id': 19099868, 'grant_title': 'DST-NRF Centre of Excellence of South Africa', 'funder_name': None, 'postDate': '2022-02-01T04:25:53'}, {'item_id': 19099868, 'grant_title': 'Academy of Finland grant no. 12265', 'funder_name': None, 'postDate': '2022-02-01T04:25:53'}, {'item_id': 19099868, 'grant_title': 'Academy of Finland grant no. 125720', 'funder_name': None, 'postDate': '2022-02-01T04:25:53'}, {'item_id': 19099868, 'grant_title': 'Academy of Finland grant no. 138049', 'funder_name': None, 'postDate': '2022-02-01T04:25:53'}, {'item_id': 19099868, 'grant_title': 'Kone Foundation', 'funder_name': None, 'postDate': '2022-02-01T04:25:53'}, {'item_id': 19099868, 'grant_title': 'Kvantum Institute', 'funder_name': None, 'postDate': '2022-02-01T04:25:53'}, {'item_id': 19099868, 'grant_title': 'Societas pro Fauna et Flora Fennica and Oskar Ã–flunds Stiftelse', 'funder_name': None, 'postDate': '2022-02-01T04:25:53'}]",6,0,12,Comparison Records,199,2022-02-01T04:25:53,1

The specimen is intended to deform in planar simple shear and is designed to be machined with a continuous annular shear zone. As a result, there are no â€œedge effectsâ€ or geometric discontinuities to generate instabilities, thus large true strains up to 1 can be achieved. Before this research, the specimen had only been used for material characterisation in the quasi-static regime. The aim of this research was to conduct further quasi-static testing using the in-plane torsion test and to extend its use into the dynamic regime. Quasi-static tests were performed on a quasi-static torsional (QST) system that was designed to be integrated onto a Zwick universal testing machine. Dynamic tests were performed on a modified torsional split Hopkinson bar</div><div>(TSHB) system. The TSHB system adopted a nested configuration which allowed for a longer incident bar, and thus larger obtainable strains. Two quick-release mechanisms were used, one using a novel reusable wedge and the other using fracture-pins. All specimens were manufactured from Al 1050 H14. Typical results agreed with material test data available in the literature. Both systems attained large strains at near-constant strain rates and together, allowed for material characterisation over a large range of strain rates. Near-uniform deformations were observed for specimens with lower strain gauge widths. An added feature of the specimen was the flat reverse face, which together with the nested configuration of both systems allows for the possibility for full-field DIC measurement in the future. An estimation method for steady-state flow stress is presented with the steady-state flow stress found to be rate dependant. Finally, a relationship between the steady-state flow stress and strain rate for all experimental results is proposed.</div>",dataset,['Mechanical engineering not elsewhere classified'],[],1,0,6,Comparison Records,144,2022-01-21T13:01:13,1

Massive stars go through a sequence of nuclear burning stages and eventually develop an onion shell structure with an iron core at the centre and several shell of lighter elements further outside. Once the iron core becomes massive enough, the core collapses either to a neutron star or to a black hole, and in most cases the envelope of the star is ejected in a gigantic supernova explosion. Such explosions are primarily responsible for producing many of the heavy elements - such as oxygen and silicon - that form the building blocks of planets like our own. Such explosions are now detected in great abundance by large-scale astronomical surveys, and they are also coveted targets for neutrino and gravitational wave detectors.</p>
<p>This data set comprises three-dimensional simulations of the convective burning processes during the final stages before the collapse and explosion, as well as simulations of the supernova explosions themselves. Several models for different stellar parameters and physical assumptions (e.g. with and without magnetic fields) have been calculated. The raw data for a complete model amount to several terabytes.

Our atlas spans a broad range of galaxy types, including ellipticals, spirals, merging galaxies, blue compact dwarfs, and luminous infrared galaxies. We have combined ground-based optical drift-scan spectrophotometry with infrared spectroscopy from Spitzer and Akari with gaps in spectral coverage being ï¬lled using Multi-wavelength Analysis of Galaxy Physical Properties spectral energy distribution models. The spectroscopy and models were normalized, constrained, and veriï¬ed with matched-aperture photometry measured from Swift, Galaxy Evolution Explorer, Sloan Digital Sky Survey, Two Micron All Sky Survey, Spitzer, and Wide-ï¬eld Infrared Space Explorer images. The availability of 26 photometric bands allowed us to identify and mitigate systematic errors present in the data. Comparison of our spectral energy distributions with other template libraries and the observed colors of galaxies indicates that we have smaller systematic errors than existing atlases, while spanning a broader range of galaxy types. Relative to the prior literature, our atlas will provide improved K-corrections, photometric redshifts, and star-formation rate calibrations.",dataset,['Galactic astronomy'],"[{'item_id': 2001141, 'grant_title': 'http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/FT100100280', 'funder_name': None, 'postDate': '2022-07-25T23:16:24'}]",1,0,13,Comparison Records,1731,2015-06-30T00:49:54,4

These interviews result from complementary research conducted as part of the ESRC postdoctoral project ""Popular infrastructural politics: Connecting grassroots knowledge and practice on marketplace governance."" This project builds on data collected in 2018, whose analysis led to the findings published in the doctoral thesis ""Popular infrastructural politics: Trader organisation and public markets in Mexico City"" (https://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/28209/). These exploratory interviews delve into the traders' adoption of digital technologies and practices in recent years (from the late 2000s onwards). Particular attention is given to how these technologies and practices have been mobilised in the traders' struggles to preserve and improve Mexico City's public markets as public infrastructures and services. The interviews capture the traders' opinions and experiences concerning the function and importance of these technologies and practices in their everyday life. In addition, the interviews provide insights into the role of digital technologies and practices in organising and resisting the impacts of urban regeneration and the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, this complementary research contributes to expanding the analysis of the market traders' political repertoires and diverse engagements in urban politics. Interviewees were recruited among research participants met while conducting the aforementioned doctoral project. Interview scripts were designed to explore the participants' engagement with digital technologies and practices. Because of their specificity, the interviews often rely on interviews and informal conversations previously held with the researcher. The interview transcripts are shared in their original language, Spanish. They have been anonymised and pseudonymised to ensure the participant's right to confidentiality.</p>

Using African Feminism as a backdrop to the application of Feminist Political Ecology, this research problematises concepts of care, time, difference and equality. This is in an attempt to bring coherence to and â€˜Africaniseâ€™ the experiences of black women in elite, masculine spaces such as extractive industries. Â It is based upon empirical study done over 5 months in Kenyaâ€™s capital Nairobi where data was collected through Â interviews and workshops where elite women got to share their experiences of working in the industry. Some men were also shared their experiences working with elite women.The lines of question involved discussions over how they perceived gender in the industry to infrastructure, race issues as well as sexism and equality. From these responses, inferences were made which pointed towards an existential system and infrastructure that was not only foreign/ western but was also designed to limit the inclusion and growth of black women in highly technical elitist positions and leadership. Â By contextualising black womenâ€™s experiences, this research therefore challenges the retrogressive discourses that define, shape and influence the way elite black African women are engaged in extractive processes reconciling existing notions of what a woman and a womanâ€™s body should be or a worker in extractives should look like. Â </p>
<p>This research presents African feminism as an alternative to/ and moving beyond western feminist ideas to include black African womenâ€™s experiences and point of view. This brings about interesting discussions on its intersectionality with feminist ideas such as leaky bodies and glass cliff and how African womenâ€™s experiences decent from western feminist ideas and the broader black feminist discussions. I argue that these experiences are intertwined to their environment and black African womenâ€™s multi-faceted identity as mothers, leaders, workers and wives makes their lived experiences unique and different from western feminism. However, in this difference, inequalities and exclusionary tendencies thrives and persists (re)creating infrastructures of marginalisation in an environment that is already white, male and patriarchal.Â It is approved through the University of Sheffield Ethics process- Reference Number 016348.

<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>Biodiversity is facing a global extinction crisis that will reduce ecological trait diversity, evolutionary history, and ultimately ecosystem functioning and services. A key challenge is understanding how species losses will impact morphological and phylogenetic diversity at global scale. Here, we test whether the loss of species threatened with extinction according to the IUCN leads to morphological and phylogenetic homogenisation across both the whole avian class, and within each biome and ecoregion globally. We use a comprehensive set of continuous morphological traits extracted from museum collections of 8455 bird species, including geometric morphometric beak shape data,9 and sequentially remove species from those at most to least threat of extinction. We find evidence of morphological, but not phylogenetic, homogenisation across the avian class, with species becoming more alike in terms of their morphology. We find that most biome and ecoregions are expected to lose morphological diversity at a greater rate than predicted by species loss alone, with the most imperilled regions found in East Asia and the Himalayan uplands and foothills. Only a small proportion of assemblages are threatened with phylogenetic homogenisation, in particular parts of Indochina. Species extinctions will lead to a major loss of avian ecological strategies, but not a comparable loss of phylogenetic diversity. As the decline of species with unique traits and their replacement with more widespread generalist species continues, the protection of assemblages at most risk of morphological and phylogenetic homogenisation should be a key conservation priority.Â </p>",dataset,"['Terrestrial ecology', 'Ecology not elsewhere classified', 'Community ecology (excl. invasive species ecology)', 'Biogeography and phylogeography', 'Speciation and extinction']",[],5,0,7,Comparison Records,255,2022-06-06T12:16:04,1

GEDI and ICESat-2 are particular in acquiring canopy height information in Canada â€” the former providing more accurate information of vegetation, yet not reaching full coverage in Canada, whilst the latter is not specifically designed to provide vegetation information but has a global coverage. We created wall-to-wall maps using ATL08 LiDAR product from the ICESat-2 satellite, and GEDI L2A from GEDI. The data were download for the mid growing season (June and August 2020). Points were filtered regarding solar background noise and atmospheric scattering, totaling 208,554 points from ICESat-2, and 1,249,354 points for GEDI after filtering and point thinning. These points were associated with 14 ancillary variables primarily corresponding to structure information, such as seasonal Sentinel-1 VV and VH polarization, seasonal Sentinel-2 red and NIR bands, and annual PALSAR-2 HH and HV polarization. Afterwards, the random forest algorithm was used to extrapolate LiDAR observations and develop regression models with the abovementioned spatially continuous variables. GEDI had a better performance than ICESat-2 with a mean difference (MD) of 0.9 m and 2.9 m in relation to ALS data used for validation, and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 4.2 m and 5.2 m, respectively. However, as both GEDI and ALS have no coverage in most of the hemi-boreal forests, ICESat-2 captures the tall canopy heights expected for these forests better than GEDI.</p>",dataset,['Forestry Sciences'],"[{'item_id': 21363081, 'grant_title': 'NSERC Alliance Grant (ALLRP 566310-21)', 'funder_name': None, 'postDate': '2022-10-20T12:23:02'}, {'item_id': 21363081, 'grant_title': 'NSERC Discovery Grant (RGPIN-2020-05,708)', 'funder_name': None, 'postDate': '2022-10-20T12:23:02'}, {'item_id': 21363081, 'grant_title': 'WWF Canada', 'funder_name': None, 'postDate': '2022-10-20T12:23:02'}, {'item_id': 21363081, 'grant_title': 'Canada Research Chairs Program', 'funder_name': None, 'postDate': '2022-10-20T12:23:02'}]",1,0,5,Comparison Records,188,2022-10-20T12:23:02,1

<p>The consumption of a meal is not just a bodily requirement but can also carry significant symbolic meaning. Solo dining is often contrasted to a shared eating experience and portrayed as an inferior way of eating a meal due to lacking essential social and normative qualities. Human-computer interaction research increasingly explores different ways of enhancing the solo dining experience. However, a focus seems to be on recreating aspects essential to the shared eating experience, such as a dining companion being present, rather than trying to enhance aspects that solo diners enjoy and, therefore, contribute to a reverie in eating. Based on earlier research findings, we developed a design concept that includes sound and visual elements supporting the multi-sensory eating experience and encouraging the user to concentrate on the food rather than seeking distraction. The formative usability evaluation results indicate that the proposed design needs further refinement to evoke the anticipated effect.Â </p>

<p>The consumption of pharmaceuticals has increased the presence of micropollutants (MPs) in the environment. The removal and degradation of pharmaceutical mixtures in different water matrices are thus of significant importance. The photocatalytic degradation of four micropollutantsâ€”diclofenac (DCF), iopamidol (INN), methylene blue (MB), and metoprolol (MTP)â€”have been analyzed in this study by using a photocatalytic ceramic membrane. We experimentally analyzed the degradation rate by using several water matrices by changing the feed composition of micropollutants in the mixture (from mg.L<sup>-1</sup> to Î¼g.L<sup>-1</sup>), adding different concentrations of inorganic compounds (NaHCO<sub>3</sub> and NaCl), and by using tap water. A maximum degradation of 97% for DCF and MTP, and 85% for INN was observed in a micropollutants mixture in tap water at environmentally relevant feed concentrations [1â€“6 Î¼g.L<sup>-1</sup>]<sub>o</sub>; and 86% for MB in an MPs mixture [1â€“3 mg.L<sup>-1</sup>]<sub>o</sub> with 100 mg.L<sup>-1</sup> Â of NaCl.

<p>The objective of this study was to investigate the response of leaf photosynthetic parameters to growth temperature and drought stress in winter wheat.

<p>For the processes of data collection: firstly, irrigation data were collected once water stress treatment was imposed. Weight of each pot was measured by weighing pots daily. Secondly, gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence data were collected simultaneously by using a portable photosynthetic system (Li-Cor 6800; Li-Cor Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA) equipped with an integrated fluorescence chamber head of 6 cm<sup>2</sup>. Lastly, the portion of the flag leaves used for gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence measurements was cut to determine its area, weight (i.e., leaf morphological data), as well as leaf carbon and nitrogen concentrations.</p>",dataset,"['Other Agricultural and Veterinary Sciences', 'Physiology', 'Ecology', 'Plant Biology']",[],4,0,7,Comparison Records,56,2022-10-13T09:25:36,1

The HCP is built-up upon exposure to methanol during the induction period, followed by a transition regime to a <em>quasi</em>-steady state MTH operation. This FASPA technique allows (sub-)second resolution of the full temporal products response upon a methanol pulse providing direct and quantitative insight into the MTH reactions. Globally two consecutive pathways can be discerned: a very fast primary product formation in the presence of methanol in a narrow active MTH reaction zone, followed by a slower formation of light aromatics, which is closely related to the decomposition and release of HCP species and secondary reactions in absence of methanol in the downstream part of the catalyst bed. The time delay between the appearance of inert tracer and primary products represents the time needed to build-up the HCP in the induction period, where methane is observed prior to other products. The primary products (alkanes, olefins, and light aromatics) are nearly instantaneously formed from the pulsed methanol. These results demonstrate the highly dynamic character of the HCP in the MTH process over H-ZSM-5.Â </p>",dataset,['Chemical Engineering'],"[{'item_id': 21316656, 'grant_title': 'Advanced Research Center Chemical Building Blocks Consortium (ARC CBBC) [grant number 2016.007.TUD]', 'funder_name': None, 'postDate': '2022-10-12T10:53:54'}]",1,0,5,Comparison Records,31,2022-10-12T10:53:54,1

<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>Temporal changes in vertical land motion (VLM) in and around Phuket Island inÂ southern Thailand following the great 2004 Sumatraâ€“Andaman megathrust earthquake have im-pacted the relative sea-level change estimates based on tide-gauge (TG) records. To better monitor the VLM, two new continuous global navigation satellite system (GNSS) stations have been installed in the past 5 years, situated on bedrock both near and at the Koh Taphao Noi Island TG in Phuket, which together with older global positioning system (GPS) data provides a clear in-sight in the VLM of Phuket Island from 1994 onward. In addition, satellite altimetry (SALT) data has been analyzed since 1992. The VLM (GPS) position and relative (TG) and absolute (SALT) sea-level change time series were successfully combined in pairs to validate each independent result (e.g., SALT âˆ’ GNSS = TG): prior to the 2004 earthquake, the relative sea-level rise in Phuket was 1.0 Â± 0.7 mm/yr, lower by 2.4 Â± 0.2 mm/yr than the absolute sea-level rise caused by VLM. After the earthquake, nonlinear post-seismic subsidence has caused the VLM to drop by 10 cm in the past 17 years, resulting, by the end of 2020, in a relative sea-level rise by up to 16 cm. During the same period, other TG stations in south Thailand recorded similar sea-level increases. Combination with SALT further suggests that, prior to 2005, uplift (5.3 Â± 1.4 mm/yr) of the coastal region of Ranong (north of Phuket) resulted in a relative sea-level fall, but since then, post-seismic-induced negative VLM may have significantly increased coastal erosion along the entire Andaman Sea coastline.Â </p>

The protocols can be tailored to any sampling density or frequency and can be used either within the <em>Natureâ€™s Notebook</em> observation program, or independently. The resulting data can be used to answer a variety of scientific and management questions from local to continental scales. The protocols are specific to major taxonomic groups and consist of a suite of â€œphenophasesâ€. A phenophase is an observable stage or phase in the annual life cycle of a plant or animal that can be defined by a start and end point. For plants, phenophases identify the presence or absence of structures (e.g., leaves, flowers, fruits) on an individual plant that is observed repeatedly over the course of one or more growing seasons. For animals, phenophases identify the presence or absence of behaviors such as breeding, migration, and use of food resources. Intensity or abundance measures for each phenophase indicate the degree to which the phenophase is expressed. They represent either an estimate of the number of plant structures or individual animals that are present or engaged in a behavior, or an estimate of the percentage of plant structures observed in a particular state (e.g., percent of flowers that are open). In this document, the phenophases in use for major plant and animal taxonomic groups are summarized in tables, and the full phenophase definitions and associated intensity or abundance measures are included in subsequent sections.</p>

By contrast, complex DNA viruses, such as those of the herpesviridae family, encode a single high-fidelity DNA polymerase. This disparity raises the possibility that DNA viruses may rely on host polymerases for synthesis through complex DNA geometries. We tested the importance of error-prone Y-family polymerases involved in translesion synthesis (TLS) to human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection. We find most Y-family polymerases involved in the nucleotide insertion and bypass of lesions restrict HCMV genome synthesis and replication. By contrast, other TLS polymerases, such as the polymerase z complex, which extends past lesions, was required for optimal genome synthesis and replication. Depletion of either the polz complex or the suite of insertion polymerases demonstrate that TLS polymerases suppress the frequency of viral genome rearrangements, particularly at GC-rich sites and repeat sequences. Moreover, while distinct from HCMV, replication of the related herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is impacted by host TLS polymerases, suggesting a broader requirement for host polymerases for DNA virus replication. These findings reveal an unexpected role for host DNA polymerases in ensuring viral genome stability.</p>

Chronic exposure to excess cortisol has detrimental effects on health, including increased stroke rates, diabetes, obesity, cognitive impairment, anxiety, depression, and death. The first-line treatment for CD is pituitary surgery, which is followed by disease remission in only 47% of patients. The lack of specificity of current standard of care treatments with low efficacy and tolerability makes CD a medical therapeutic challenge. One major limitation that hinders the development of specific medical therapies is the lack of human relevant model systems that recapitulate the cellular composition of pituitary adenomas. Human pituitary adenoma tissue was harvested during transsphenoidal surgery from CD patients to generate organoids (hPITOs). hPITOs generated from corticotroph, lactotroph, gonadotroph and somatotroph adenomas exhibited morphological diversity among the organoid lines between individual patients and amongst subtypes. The similarity in cell lineages between the organoid line and the patientâ€™s tumor was validated by comparing the neuropathology report, to the expression pattern of pituitary adenoma specific markers using spectral flow cytometry and exome sequencing. A high-throughput drug screen demonstrated patient-specific drug responses of hPITOs amongst each adenoma subtype. Generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from patients carrying germline mutations relevant to CD exhibited dysregulated cell lineage commitment. The development of the human pituitary adenoma organoids represent a paradigm shift in how we model complex pathologies in CD patients that may alter patient care.</p>

COCA is also related to other large corpora that we have created. The corpus contains more than 450 million words of text and is equally divided among spoken, fiction, popular magazines, newspapers, and academic texts. It includes 20 million words each year from 1990-2012 and the corpus is also updated regularly (the most recent texts are from Summer 2012). Because of its design, it is perhaps the only corpus of English that is suitable for looking at current, ongoing changes in the language.</p>

In addition to the typical peripheral limb motor symptoms, vocal motor issues such as deteriorated vocal quality are present in Parkinson's patients. Unfortunately, very little is known about the biological mechanisms underlying these vocal changes. Here, we developed a Parkinsonian model using the zebra finch songbird to study the underlying neural mechanisms of these changes. Finch song and supportive brain areas are similar to human speech and brain pathways. To do this, we recorded song for 2 hours from zebra finches injected with an adeno-associated virus expressing either the causally-related human Parkinsonian gene SNCA or control GFP protein in finch brain. Song was then segmented using a specially designed matlab program called Vocal Inventory Clustering Engine (VoICE) into unique syllables. Acoustic features such as duration, pitch, mean frequency, amplitude, Wiener Entropy, frequency modulation, and amplitude modulation were measured from 75 individual copies of these syllables. The mean, mean variance, and coefficient of variation of these syllables were also measured. Motif-level data was also collected to monitor how much each bird sang (i.e., how many copies of song were uttered over a 2 hour period). We found that overexpression of SNCA led to shorter and poorer quality syllables that are similar to Parkinsonian vocal changes.<div><br></div><div><div><br></div><div>To cite this work, please cite both the associated PLoS One paper ""<a href=""https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0265604"">Vocal changes in a zebra finch model of Parkinsonâ€™s Disease characterized by alpha-synuclein overexpression in the song-dedicated anterior forebrain pathway</a>"" and this dataset.</div><div><br></div><div><hr></div><div><i><br></i></div><div><i>For inquiries regarding the contents of this dataset, please contact the Corresponding Author listed in the README.txt file.

However, most studies of intermittent streams are conducted at extremes of scale, are limited in taxonomic and temporal scope, and focus exclusively on drying patterns. Here, we assessed how both flow intermittency and orientation to perennial refuges affect aquatic invertebrates and aquatic and semi-aquatic vertebrates across two years within two intermittent river basins differing in their aridity. We used loggers to characterize flow intermittency and wet-dry mapping to determine orientation to perennial refuge of reaches. In winter and summer 2015 and 2016, we collected and identified invertebrates and visually surveyed vertebrates. Using permutational multivariate analyses of variance with distance matrices, we found distinct invertebrate communities by basin, flow class (perennial or intermittent), and season, and distinct vertebrate communities by basin, and between flow classes and seasons in the more arid basin. Invertebrate communities had higher beta diversity in the more arid than mesic basin, whereas the opposite was true for vertebrates. We identified indicator species for all combinations of basin and flow class, perennial reaches combined from both basins, each basin, and some combinations of flow class and season within basins. Flow intermittency and orientation to perennial refuge predictors correlated well with both invertebrate and vertebrate communities. However, we did not find nestedness of communities that differed significantly from that expected by chance in response to increasing flow intermittency or distance to refuge. Lastly, basin, flow intermittency, and orientation to perennial refuge predictors were generally important for modeling taxon richness and densities, and richness and densities decreased with increasing flow intermittency and distance to perennial refuge. Collectively, our data suggest that intermittent streams harbor unique biodiversity, but also that some taxa have context-dependent responses to intermittency and orientation to perennial refuges.

We investigated how drought affects carbon and water fluxes in addition to soil-plant-atmosphere interactions by tracing <sup>13</sup>CO<sub>2</sub> and deep-water <sup>2</sup>H<sub>2</sub>O label pulses and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in an enclosed experimental rainforest. Ecosystem dynamics were driven by different plant functional group responses to drought. Drought- sensitive canopy trees dominated total fluxes but also exhibited the strongest response to topsoil drying. Although all canopy-forming trees had access to deep water, these reserves were spared until late in the drought. Belowground carbon transport was slowed, yet allocation of fresh carbon to VOCs remained high. Atmospheric VOC composition reflected increasing stress responses and dynamic soil-plant- atmosphere interactions, potentially affecting atmospheric chemistry and climate feedbacks. These interactions and distinct functional group strategies thus modulate drought impacts and ecosystem susceptibility to climate change. </div><div><br></div></div></div><div><div><hr></div><div><br></div><div><i>For inquiries regarding the contents of this dataset, please contact the Corresponding Author listed in the README.txt file.

Modeling long-term variability of Eurasian runoff to the Arctic Ocean is complicated by the considerable variability of river discharge in time and space, and the monitoring constraints imposed by a sparse gauged-flow network and paucity of satellite data. We quantify tree growth response to river discharge at the upper reaches of the Yenisei River in Tuva, South Siberia. Two regression models built from eight tree-ring width chronologies of <i>Larix sibirica </i>are applied to reconstruct winter (Novâ€“Apr) discharge for the period 1784-1997 (214 years), and annual (Octâ€“Sept) discharge for the period 1701â€“2000 (300 years). The Novâ€“Apr model explains 52% of the discharge variance whereas Octâ€“Sept explains 26% for the calibration intervals 1927â€“1997 and 1927-2000, respectively. This new hydrological archive doubles the length of the instrumental discharge record at the Kyzyl gauge and resets the temporal background of discharge variability back to 1784. The reconstruction finds a remarkable 80% upsurge in winter flow over the last 25 years, which is unprecedented in the last 214 years. In contrast, annual discharge fluctuated normally for this system, with only a 7% increase over the last 25 years. Water balance modeling with CRU data manifests a significant discrepancy between decadal variability of the gauged flow and climate data after 1960. We discuss the impact on the baseflow rate change of both the accelerating permafrost warming in the discontinuous zone of South Siberia and widespread forest fires. The winter discharge accounts for only one third of the annual flow, yet the persistent 25-year upsurge is alarming. This trend is likely caused by Arctic Amplification, which can be further magnified by increased winter flow delivering significantly more fresh water to the Kara Sea during the cold season.<br><br></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><i><br>For inquiries regarding the contents of this dataset, please contact the Corresponding Author listed in the README.txt file.

<p>We explain why citizens believed and shared false political information during the 2019 UK general election campaign. In two surveys of samples mirroring the adult population conducted before the vote (total N=4018), we showed respondents 24 different news statements and asked if they had seen them before, whether they believed them, and how likely they would be to share them on social media. The statements included actual disinformation that was circulating and had been debunked, placebos that did not feature in the campaign but were carefully constructed to resemble actual false statements spreading at the time, and true statements that were being reported during the campaign. We find that the more that respondents received their campaign news via professional news organizations, the more they were able to distinguish true from false information. Conversely, the more that respondents used social media for campaign news, the less they were able to distinguish true from false information. These differences also shaped the intention to share true versus false news, and false news, once perceived as accurate, was more likely to be shared than true news overall. This â€œcampaign disinformation divideâ€ between getting news from professional journalistic organizations and news from social media has important implications for contemporary election campaigns in democratic public spheres.Â </p>",dataset,[],[],0,1,5,Comparison Records,9,2022-10-25T14:37:16,1

<p>Despite the bidirectional relationship between sleep and mental health, the effect of interventions to improve sleep quality for inpatients from secure psychiatric settings has not been examined. The current work aimed to identify the effect of interventions for improving sleep quality for these inpatients and identify moderating factors. Eligible studies involved secure psychiatric inpatients (adult) and included a quantitative measure of sleep as primary outcome. The Cochrane Library, Scopus, PubMed and ProQuest were searched; last searched October 2021. 12,409 abstracts were screened for inclusion. The systematic review included 38 studies. The meta-analysis included 22 studies (36 trials).Sleep Quality, Insomnia Severity, Total Sleep Time and Sleep Efficiency were outcomes. The total pooled effect size for all interventions (random-effects model) was d=0.54, (p<0.0001,95% CI:0.30,0.77). Subset-analyses indicated the pooled effect sizes for behavioural interventions as d=0.65, (p<0.01,95% CI:0.16,1.14), medical interventions as d=0.58, (p<0.001,95% CI:0.25,0.91),environmental interventions as d=0.19, (p=0.38,95% CI:-0.24,0.62). Based upon duration, interventions of a five-to-ten-week period were most effective, d=0.92, (p<0.005,95% CI:0.29,1.55). Males reported a greater improvement in sleep than females. Sleep quality interventions in this population are effective. Behavioural interventions: Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for insomnia and physical activity, are most impactful. Clinical practitioners should consider implementing behavioural interventions, of a five-to-ten-week period.Â </p>",dataset,[],"[{'item_id': 21394662, 'grant_title': 'Loughborough University', 'funder_name': None, 'postDate': '2022-10-25T13:08:05'}, {'item_id': 21394662, 'grant_title': 'St Andrewâ€™s Healthcare', 'funder_name': None, 'postDate': '2022-10-25T13:08:05'}]",0,1,6,Comparison Records,15,2022-10-25T12:51:09,1

<p>Â We use a unique, nationally representative, survey of UK social media users (n = 2,005) to identify the main factors associated with a specific and particularly troubling form of sharing behavior: the amplification of exaggerated and false news. Our conceptual framework and research design advance research in two ways. First, we pinpoint and measure behavior that is intended to spread, rather than correct or merely draw attention to, misleading information. Second, we test this behaviorâ€™s links to a wider array of explanatory factors than previously considered in research on mis-/disinformation. Our main findings are that a substantial minorityâ€”a tenthâ€”of UK social media users regularly engages in the amplification of exaggerated or false news on UK social media. This behavior is associated with four distinctive, individual-level, factors: (1) increased use of Instagram, but not other public social media platforms, for political news; (2) what we term identity-performative sharing motivations; (3) negative affective orientation toward social media as a space for political news; and (4) right wing ideology. We discuss the implications of these findings and the need for further research on how platform affordances and norms, emotions, and ideology matter for the diffusion of dis-/misinformation.</p>",dataset,[],[],0,1,8,Comparison Records,50,2022-10-04T14:33:03,1

<p>Â </p>
<p>Objectives: The aims of this study were to determine whether lumbar areal bone mineral density differed between cricket fast bowlers with and without lumbar stress fracture, and whether bone mineral density trajectories differed between groups during rehabilitation.Â </p>
<p>Design: Cross-sectional and cohort.Â </p>
<p>Methods: 29 elite male fast bowlers received a post-season anteroposterior lumbar dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scan and a lumbar magnetic resonance imaging scan to determine stress fracture status. Participants were invited for three additional scans across the 59 weeks post baseline or diagnosis of injury. Bone mineral density was measured at L1 â€“ L4 and ipsilateral and contralateral L3 and L4 sites. Independent-sample t-tests determined baseline differences in bone mineral density and multilevel models were used to examine differences in bone mineral density trajectories over time between injured and uninjured participants.Â </p>
<p>Results: 17 participants with lumbar stress fracture had lower baseline bone mineral density at L1 â€“ L4 (7.6 %, p = 0.034) and contralateral sites (8.8â€“10.4 %, p = 0.038â€“0.058) than uninjured participants. Bone mineral density at all sites decreased 1.9â€“3.0 % by 20â€“24 weeks before increasing to above baseline levels by 52 weeks post injury.Â </p>
<p>Conclusions: Injured fast bowlers had lower lumbar bone mineral density at diagnosis that decreased following injury and did not return to baseline until up to a year post-diagnosis. Localised maladaptation of bone mineral density may contribute to lumbar stress fracture. Bone mineral density loss following injury may increase risk of recurrence, therefore fast bowlers require careful management when returning to play.</p>

<p>The UK will need to decarbonise low temperature industrial waste heat (up to â‰ˆ250 Â°C) to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emission targets. Industrial waste heat production represents an opportunity for reduction in the use of primary fuels used in the production of commodities. Energy inefficient processes in addition to increased emissions raises the cost of plant operation, â€“ an undesirable scenario for both industrial competitiveness and the environment. Less is known about the quantity and potential applications for recovered low temperature industrial waste heat in UK and the quantification and characterisation of the resource can provide the needed impetus for the development and adoption of green technologies to help achieve the 2050 Net-Zero target. In this work the potential magnitude of the low temperature industrial waste heat resource in the UK is analysed by using sector-level energy intensity values for different industries while drawing on corresponding estimates from previous studies in the USA and by closely mapping the UK Standard Industrial Classification (SIC 2007) against sectors in the USA (NAICS [North American Industry Classification System]). The assessment undertaken finds that the recoverable potential of low temperature waste heat up to â‰ˆ250 Â°C could be up to 83.7% of the total estimated waste heat potential in UK industry. Significant opportunities exist in this low temperature range for waste heat recovery actions at individual sites. Research and Development (R&D) into alternative improved methods for waste heat recovery, storage, and use (WHRSU) technologies could also produce significant positive environmental and industrial impact.Â </p>",dataset,[],"[{'item_id': 21270108, 'grant_title': 'DEcarbonisation of Low TemperAture Process Heat Industry, DELTA PHI', 'funder_name': 'Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council', 'postDate': '2022-10-04T12:24:48'}]",0,1,6,Comparison Records,48,2022-10-04T12:24:48,1

<p>This WHO-commissioned review contributed to the update of complementary feeding recommendations, synthesizing evidence on effects of unhealthy food and beverage consumption in children on overweight and obesity. We searched PubMed (Medline), Cochrane CENTRAL, and Embase for articles, irrespective of language or geography. Inclusion criteria were: 1) randomized controlled trials (RCTs), non-RCTs, cohort studies, and pre/post studies with control; 2) participantsÂ aged â‰¤10.9 y at exposure; 3) studies reporting greater consumption of unhealthy foods/beverages compared with no or low consumption; 4) studies assessing anthropometric and/or body composition; and 5) publication dateÂ â‰¥1971. Unhealthy foods and beverages were defined using nutrient- and food-based approaches. Risk of bias was assessed using the ROBINS-I (risk of bias in nonrandomized studies of interventions version I) and RoB2 [Cochrane RoB (version 2)] tools for nonrandomized and randomized studies, respectively. Narrative synthesis was complemented by meta-analyses where appropriate. Certainty of evidence was assessed using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation. Of 26,542 identified citations, 60 studies from 71 articles were included. Most studies were observational (59/60), and no included studies were from low-income countries. The evidence base was low quality, as assessed by ROBINS-I and RoB2 tools. Evidence synthesis was limited by the different interventions and comparators across studies. Evidence indicated that consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) and unhealthy foods in childhood may increase BMI/BMI z-score, percentage body fat, or odds of overweight/obesity (low certainty of evidence). Artificially sweetened beverages and 100% fruit juice consumption make little/no difference to BMI, percentage body fat, or overweight/obesity outcomes (low certainty of evidence). Meta-analyses of a subset of studies indicated a positive association between SSB intake and percentage body fat, but no association with change in BMI and BMI z-score. High-quality epidemiological studies that are designed to assess the effects of unhealthy food consumption during childhood on risk of overweight/obesity are needed to contribute to a more robust evidence base upon which to design policy recommendations.

<p>This paper provides a standardised methodology to assess the suitability of using stand-alone solar photovoltaic (PV) systems for different productive uses of energy (PUE) at a country-wide level. The focus has been on the country of Tanzania, but the methodology is suitable for any location. This analysis has reviewed fourteen different PUE categories,with several sub-categories. The PUEwere assessed for awide range of factors, including cost of the system, potential income from the PUE, and potential market size. This report also highlights the PUE load profiles and energy requirements for comparison.</p>
<p>Assessing a potential productive use is a complex process with multiple stakeholders and decision factors. The analysis here is not meant as a definitive answer, but to highlight the technical characteristics and economics of the potential productive uses for comparison. This methodology is a first passmethod to assess the suitability of stand-alone PV systems for PUE applications at a country-wide level. For more detailed analysis of the PUE potential, the enabling environment, socio-cultural context and supporting services must be investigated in much greater detail. The quantitative methodology given here used computer-based simulation tools, including data processing (Excel & Python), geographical information systems (QGIS) and power system simulation (HOMER Pro). Input data from multiple sources, including in-country fieldwork, was used.

<p>Critical comments from parents or coaches about weight or shape have been associated with athletesâ€™ body dissatisfaction and disordered eating. However, research is yet to explore how critical comments from an athleteâ€™s teammates may impact on eating and exercise psychopathology. This study aimed to (1) explore whether athletes who reported receiving a teammate critical comment have higher eating/exercise psychopathology and poorer psychological wellbeing versus matched athletes who have not, (2) determine whether gender differences exist in the perceived severity of critical comments and (3) evaluate the moderating role of gender when establishing the relative importance of explicit teammate critical comments versus implicit teammate influences (e.g., modelling) on eating/exercise psychopathology. Athletes (N=646, Mage=23 years, n=391 female) completed a survey exploring explicit/implicit teammate influences, psychological wellbeing (self-esteem, anxiety, depression) and eating/exercise psychopathology. Athletes receiving a teammate critical comment (n=323) had significantly higher eating/exercise psychopathology, anxiety, and lower self-esteem compared to those who had not (n=323). Females (n=196) perceived the severity of the comment to be significantly worse than males (n=127). Explicit critical comments had a greater influence on athletesâ€™ eating/exercise psychopathology versus implicit teammate influences. Disordered eating/compulsive exercise prevention efforts with athlete populations should highlight the detrimental impact that athletesâ€™ comments can have on teammatesâ€™ wellbeing and body satisfaction.Â </p>",dataset,[],"[{'item_id': 21230843, 'grant_title': 'Loughborough University', 'funder_name': None, 'postDate': '2022-09-29T14:06:53'}]",0,1,6,Comparison Records,43,2022-09-29T14:06:53,1

<p>Â </p>
<p>Background. Adolescents in secure psychiatric care typically report high obesity rates. However, longitudinal research exploring the rate and extent of change is sparse. This study aimed to analyse sex differences in longitudinal body mass index (BMI) change for adolescents receiving treatment in a secure psychiatric hospital.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Methods.The sample comprised 670 adolescents in secure psychiatric care. BMI trajectories from admission to 50â€‰months of hospitalisation were produced using sex-stratified multilevel models. Systematic difference in mean BMI trajectories according to age at admission (14, 15, 16, or 17â€‰years), medication (Olanzapine or Sodium Valproate), and primary diagnosis (Psychotic, non-Psychotic or Functional/behavioural disorders) were investigated.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Results.Together, males and females experienced a mean BMI increase of 2.22â€‰m/kg2 over the 50-month period. For females, BMI increased from 25.69â€‰m/kg2 to 30.31â€‰m/kg2, and for males, reduced from 25.01â€‰m/kg2 to 23.95â€‰m/kg2. From 30 to 50â€‰months, a plateau was observed for females and a reduction in BMI observed for males. Psychotic disorders in males (Î² 3.87; CI 1.1â€“6.7) were associated with the greatest rate of BMI change. For medication, Olanzapine in females was associated with the greatest rate of change (Î²1.78; CI âˆ’.89â€“4.47).</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Conclusions.This is the first longitudinal study exploring longitudinal BMI change for adolescent inpatients. Results highlight that individual differences in adolescent inpatients result in differing levels of risk to weight gain in secure care. Specifically, males with psychotic disorders and females taking Olanzapine present the greatest risk of weight gain. This has implications for the prioritisation of interventions for those most at risk of weight gain.</p>",dataset,[],"[{'item_id': 21120490, 'grant_title': 'Body size trajectories and cardio-metabolic resilience to obesity in three United Kingdom birth cohorts', 'funder_name': 'Medical Research Council', 'postDate': '2022-09-15T15:07:12'}]",0,1,5,Comparison Records,42,2022-09-15T15:07:12,1

<p>Hydroxylative dearomatization reactions of phenols (HPD) offer an efficient way to assemble complex, biologically relevant scaffolds. Despite this, enantioselective hydroxylative phenol dearomatizations for the construction of bicyclo[2.2.2]octenones are classically limited to stoichiometric chiral reagents, and a practical, enantioselective catalytic method has remained elusive. Herein, we describe a highly enantioselective, organocatalytic tandem o-HPD-[4+2] reaction. Our methodology utilizes a chiral oxaziridinium organocatalyst, that is available in both enantiomeric forms, to afford dearomatized products in high enantioselectivity over a range of phenol substitution patterns. This approach was applied to the highly enantioselective synthesis of (+)-biscarvacrol (99â€‰:â€‰1 e.r.) and (âˆ’)-bis(2,6-xylenol) (94â€‰:â€‰6 e.r.).

<p>Despite strong genetic implications of NLRP3 inflammasome, its examination as genetic determinant of ischaemic stroke (IS) remains to be done in Punjab, which has been investigated in this study. In this case control study, 400 subjects (200 IS patients, 200 stroke free controls) were included. Contributions of 5 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) including a functional SNP within NLRP3 gene (rs10754558, rs4612666, rs2027432, rs3738488 and rs1539019) for the risk of IS were investigated through genetic models after correcting the effect of significant variables. Plasma levels of three pro-inflammatory markers, that is, C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-1beta (IL-1Î²) and interleukin-18 (IL-18) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Minor alleles of 3 out of 5 SNPs (rs10754558, rs4612666 and rs1539019) exhibited association with IS risk in additive, recessive and multiplicative models. Multivariable regression analysis confirmed that higher levels of systolic blood pressure (<em>Î²</em> Â± SE: 1.42 Â± 0.57, <em>p</em>Â =Â .013), CRP (<em>Î²</em> Â± SE: 1.22 Â± 0.41, <em>p</em>Â =Â .003), IL-1Î² (<em>Î²</em> Â± SE: 1.78 Â± 0.88, <em>p</em>Â =Â .043) and IL-18 (<em>Î²</em> Â± SE: 1.13 Â± 0.49, <em>p</em>Â =Â .021) were independent risk predictors for IS. Haplotype analysis revealed a susceptibility putative haplotype GTGTA, which approximately doubled the IS risk (OR: 1.98, 95% CI: 1.12â€“3.78, <em>p</em>Â =Â .04) in dominant mode after adjusting the effect with confounding variables. This susceptibility putative haplotype GTGTA was significantly associated with increased concentrations of CRP (<em>Î²</em>Â =Â 1.21, <em>p</em>Â =Â .014) and IL-1Î² (<em>Î²</em>Â =Â 1.53, <em>p</em>Â =Â .034) in dose-dependent manner (less in carriers of 1 copy than those who had 2 copies of GTGTA).</p>

<p><br></p>
<p>The study purpose was to examine the biomechanical characteristics of sports wheelchair propulsion and determine biomechanical associations with shoulder pain in wheelchair athletes. Twenty wheelchair court-sport athletes (age: 32Â±11 years old) performed one submaximal propulsion trial in their sports-specific wheelchair at 1.67m.s-1 for three minutes and two 10-second sprints on a dual-roller ergometer. The Performance Corrected Wheelchair Userâ€™s Shoulder Pain Index (PC-WUSPI) assessed shoulder pain. During the acceleration phase of wheelchair sprinting, participants propelled with significantly longer push times, larger forces and thorax flexion range of motion (ROM) than both the maximal velocity phase of sprinting and submaximal propulsion. Participants displayed significantly greater peak glenohumeral abduction and scapular internal rotation during the acceleration phase (20 Â± 9Â° and 45 Â± 7Â°) and maximal velocity phase (14 Â± 4Â° and 44 Â± 7Â°) of sprinting, compared to submaximal propulsion (12 Â± 6Â° and 39 Â± 8Â°). Greater shoulder pain severity was associated with larger glenohumeral abduction ROM (r = 0.59, P = 0.007) and scapular internal rotation ROM (r = 0.53, P = 0.017) during the acceleration phase of wheelchair sprinting, but with lower peak glenohumeral flexion (r = -0.49, P = 0.030), peak abduction (r = -0.48, P =0.034) and abduction ROM (r = -0.44, P = 0.049) during the maximal velocity phase. Biomechanical characteristics of wheelchair sprinting suggest this activity imposes greater mechanical stress than submaximal propulsion. Kinematic associations with shoulder pain during acceleration are in shoulder orientations linked to a reduced subacromial space, potentially increasing tissue stress.Â </p>

<p>This study aims to encourage the large scale production of micro-cellulose fibres (MCF), especially in developing economies. Micro-fibres have been extracted from banana pseudo-stem agro-wastes to valorise the latter. The particularity of this study is that a commercial food wet grinder, an equipment necessitating less investment cost as compared to the traditional supermass colloider (SMC) machine, has been employed to yield micro-fibres. For enabling maximum controllability of the process, the effect of two grinding parameters (the gap distance and the number of passes) were investigated. The results revealed the viability of such a mechanical equipment: from SEM results, 95% reduction in fibre diameter (comparable to the 99% size reduction for the SMC machine) and from XRD results, high percentage crystallinity (76 â€“ 80% corresponding to an increase of 25-30%) were obtained. The optimal conditions resulting in these conditions were: smallest possible gap distance (800Âµm) and highest number of passes (30). Another singularity of this study is that the gap distance proved to be more important than the number of passes in terms of the fibre diameter reduction, lignin and hemicellulose reduction, crystallinity and fibrillation. Lignin and hemicellulose, despite having been decreased to 13% and 7-9% respectively during the process, have been observed to enhance fibrillation. Thus, a high degree of fibrillation (yielding micro-fibres of diameter 1 â€“ 2 Âµm) was obtained at a relatively low power consumption (4.1 kWh/kg fibre). Finally, a detailed explanatory mechanism based on the literature-reported viscoelasticity of lignin has been given to explain how it facilitates fibrillation.</p>",dataset,['Chemical engineering not elsewhere classified'],"[{'item_id': 20768572, 'grant_title': 'Higher Education Commission, Mauritius', 'funder_name': None, 'postDate': '2022-09-01T14:14:26'}]",1,1,6,Comparison Records,30,2022-09-01T14:14:26,1

A highly selective molecular separation process can be achieved from hydrophilic membranes with well-defined pores. Herein, we report a blend membrane surface modified with polycarbene stabilized silver species for molecular separation. The excellent separation performance and the high flux of the selective membrane have been attributed to the thin selective layer containing hollow spheres and that filled with silver nanoparticles, which provide the complete rejection of dyes bearing molecular sizes >1.4 nm. The outstanding separation performance of the surface-modified membrane is due to both Donnan exclusion and adsorption effects. The simple surface-modification strategy for blend membranes is adaptable to a variety of other transition metals.

<p>The low efficiency and high costs involved in harvesting microalgae and extracting lipids have been major barriers toward large scale algae-based biofuel production. Here we demonstrate the feasibility of employing seawater as a substitute for freshwater in cultivating Chlorella sorokiniana SDEC-18. Strikingly, compared to freshwater, seawater was found to 1) enhance Chlorella autoflocculation, reaching 90 % settling efficiency within 2 h; 2) promote lipid accumulation, reaching about 60 % (0.19â€“0.28 g/L of lipid concentration) due to salinity stress; and 3) improve lipid-extraction efficiency, with full extraction achieved after only the second extraction step. The mechanisms for enhanced Chlorella harvest were revealed through the observation of extracellular polymeric substances using transmission electron microscopy after lanthanum fixation. Moreover, new insights into cell fragility under salinity stress have been obtained through our pioneering proposal of the involvement of Chlorella microtubules.

<p>The controlled synthesis of amphiphilic di-block copolymers allows a large array of nanostructures to be created, including block copolymer particles, which have proved valuable for biomedical applications. Despite progress in targeting specific block copolymer architectures, control over the size and stability of spherical particles is less well explored. Here, we report the use of RAFT emulsion polymerisation to synthesise a library of p(MMA) particles, crosslinked with ethylene glycol dimethacrylate and stabilised by brush-like poly(ethylene glycol)-based polymers. We successfully synthesised a range of block copolymer particles, offering stability up to p(MMA)<sub>1000</sub>, with DLS reporting stable particle diameters of 33â€“176 nm and PDI < 0.2. DLS and AFM studies showed a general increase in particle diameter with increasing amounts of p(MMA).

<p>When are voters more likely to project their own political position onto a candidate for office? We investigate this question by examining the assumed partisanship of a (self-declared) centrist politician, using data from an original survey experiment fielded in Canada, the UK, and the US. In doing so, we build on the Social Categorization Model as well as recent US-focussed political science research on projection and in-group/out-group racial divides â€“ extending our analysis to incorporate racial and class similarities/differences across three countries where these divides likely vary in salience. We thus seek to: (1) contribute to research on the inferences citizens draw in nonpartisan elections and low-information contexts generally; and (2) highlight some potential methodological complications of using partisanship-less candidates in vignette experiments. Results suggest that even in the face of a self-declared centrist, voters from across the political spectrum tended to assume shared partisanship in Canada, the UK, and the US. Examining projection by in-group/out-group divisions indicated that class appears to shape projection across all three countries, but that the racial divide only mattered in the US. Finally, we also find evidence of counterprojection toward out-group members â€“ but once again only in the American context.Â Â </p>",dataset,[],"[{'item_id': 20368098, 'grant_title': 'H2020 Marie SkÅ‚odowska-Curie Actions.

<p><br></p>
<p>Historically it has been assumed that abiotic forces dominate fluvial sediment dynamics. However, a growing body of work indicates that biological energy can also exert a significant control over sediment dynamics. The role that invasive species may play in altering fine sediment dynamics is particularly pertinent given that any influence may disrupt the natural equilibrium of the ecosystem. Here we investigated the effect of invasive signal crayfish (Pacisfastcus leniusculus) on the transport and storage of fine sediment in a densely populated river compared with a nearby control river without crayfish, over an 18-week period. We observed clear evidence of diurnal fluctuations in turbidity associated with crayfish presence including periodograms with power peaks at a period of 1â€‰day. Fine sediment fluxes indicated that crayfish contributed on average 18.5% extra to baseflow loads than would be likely under abiotic forcing alone. Temporal variations in suspended sediment concentrations were also observed at the control site but these were different in character and exhibited no clear temporal pattern or consistency as confirmed by periodogram analysis. Crayfish did not have an effect on sediment ingress rates relative to the control site and, at the crayfish site, the reach scale sediment budget was in net equilibrium during the sampling period. Our results provide further evidence that biological energy alters riverine fine sediment dynamics and warrants consideration in sediment dynamic models.Â </p>",dataset,['Ecology not elsewhere classified'],"[{'item_id': 20368023, 'grant_title': 'Glendonbrook studentship', 'funder_name': None, 'postDate': '2022-07-25T11:31:53'}]",1,1,9,Comparison Records,102,2022-07-25T11:31:53,1

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>Low-likelihood weather events can cause dramatic impacts, especially when they are unprecedented. In 2020, amongst other high-impact weather events, UK floods caused more than Â£300 million damage, prolonged heat over Siberia led to infrastructure failure and permafrost thawing, while wildfires ravaged California. Such rare phenomena cannot be studied well from historical records or reanalysis data. One way to improve our awareness is to exploit ensemble prediction systems, which represent large samples of simulated weather events. This â€˜UNSEENâ€™ method has been successfully applied in several scientific studies, but uptake is hindered by large data and processing requirements, and by uncertainty regarding the credibility of the simulations. Here, we provide a protocol to apply and ensure credibility of UNSEEN for studying low-likelihood high-impact weather events globally, including an open workflow based on Copernicus Climate Change Services (C3S) seasonal predictions. Demonstrating the workflow using European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) SEAS5, we find that the 2020 Marchâ€“May Siberian heatwave was predicted by one of the ensemble members; and that the record-shattering August 2020 California-Mexico temperatures were part of a strong increasing trend. However, each of the case studies exposes challenges with respect to the credibility of UNSEEN and the sensitivity of the outcomes to user decisions. We conclude that UNSEEN can provide new insights about low-likelihood weather events when the decisions are transparent, and the challenges and sensitivities are acknowledged. Anticipating plausible low-likelihood extreme events and uncovering unforeseen hazards under a changing climate warrants further research at the science-policy interface to manage high impacts.</p>",dataset,['Atmospheric sciences not elsewhere classified'],"[{'item_id': 20300814, 'grant_title': 'Loughborough University', 'funder_name': None, 'postDate': '2022-07-13T12:57:05'}, {'item_id': 20300814, 'grant_title': 'European Union Copernicus Programme', 'funder_name': None, 'postDate': '2022-07-13T12:57:05'}, {'item_id': 20300814, 'grant_title': 'Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, UK Government.

<p><br></p>
<p>Purpose:Â </p>
<p>Neuromuscular power is critical for healthy ageing. Conventional older adult resistance training (RT) guidelines typically recommend lifting slowly (2-s; CONV), whereas fast/explosive contractions performed either non-ballistically (FAST-NB) or ballistically (FAST-B, attempting to throw the load) may involve greater acute power production, and could ultimately provide a greater chronic power adaptation stimulus. To compare the neuromechanics (power, force, velocity, and muscle activation) of different types of concentric isoinertial RT contractions in older adults.Â </p>
<p>Methods:Â </p>
<p>Twelve active older adult males completed three sessions, each randomly assigned to one type of concentric contraction (CONV or FAST-NB or FAST-B). Each session involved lifting a range of loads (20â€“80%1RM) using an instrumented isoinertial leg press dynamometer that measured power, force, and velocity. Muscle activation was assessed with surface electromyography (sEMG).Â </p>
<p>Results:Â </p>
<p>Peak and mean power were markedly different, according to the concentric contraction explosive intent FAST-B > FAST-NB > CONV, with FAST-B producing substantially more power (+ 49 to 1172%, P â‰¤ 0.023), force (+ 10 to 136%, P < 0.05) and velocity (+ 55 to 483%, P â‰¤ 0.025) than CONV and FAST-NB contractions. Knee and hip extensor sEMG were typically higher during FAST-B than CON (all P < 0.02) and FAST-NB (â‰¤ 50%1RM, P â‰¤ 0.001).Â </p>
<p>Conclusions:Â </p>
<p>FAST-B contractions produced markedly greater power, force, velocity and muscle activation across a range of loads than both CONV or FAST-NB and could provide a more potent RT stimulus for the chronic development of older adult power.</p>",dataset,[],"[{'item_id': 20296914, 'grant_title': 'Arthritis Research UK Centre for Sport, Exercise and Osteoarthritis', 'funder_name': 'Versus Arthritis', 'postDate': '2022-07-13T11:22:07'}]",0,1,4,Comparison Records,123,2022-07-13T11:22:07,1

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>Riverine communities have been subject to numerous biological invasion events, with crustaceans among the most successful group of invasive animals worldwide. Understanding what makes a river system prone to invasion is of considerable interest to environmental regulators, resource managers, scientists and wider society globally. The Ponto-Caspian amphipod, <em>Dikerogammarus haemobaphes</em> (Crustacea: Gammaridae), is a hyper-successful invasive species that was first recorded in the UK in 2012. The use of contemporary distribution data for <em>D. haemobaphes</em> (2009â€“2020) from England provided a unique opportunity to study faunal community patterns and differences between sites that experienced invasion compared to those that have not. Macroinvertebrate community taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic features, as well as the presence of co-occurrent invaders and abiotic features of the river systems, were examined from sites before the invasion and compared to control sites that were not invaded during the study period. Sites that would later experience invasion by <em>D. haemobaphes</em> were characterized by higher abundances of other invaders (e.g., especially Ponto Caspian taxa), lower abundances of crustaceans and typically had greater channel width and water depth. These basic characteristics may help identify sites at risk of future invasion by <em>D. haemobaphes</em>. Most biomonitoring tools examined displayed no difference between control and pre-invaded samples, while both taxonomic and functional richness displayed higher values at sites that were subsequently invaded, questioning classic biological invasion hypotheses. Recognizing specific community characteristics that may be a precondition for subsequent invasion is essential for understanding and better predicting their future trajectories of change.</p>

<p>Objective</p>
<p>In a convenience sample of athletes, we conducted a survey of COVID-19-mediated lockdown (termed â€˜lockdownâ€™ from this point forward) effects on: (i) circadian rhythms; (ii) sleep; (iii) eating; and (iv) training behaviors.</p>
<p>Methods</p>
<p>In total, 3911 athletes [mean age: 25.1 (range 18â€“61) years, 1764 female (45%), 2427 team-sport (63%) and 1442 elite (37%) athletes] from 49 countries completed a multilingual cross-sectional survey including the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and Insomnia Severity Index questionnaires, alongside bespoke questions about napping, training, and nutrition behaviors.</p>
<p>Results</p>
<p>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (4.3â€‰Â±â€‰2.4 to 5.8â€‰Â±â€‰3.1) and Insomnia Severity Index (4.8â€‰Â±â€‰4.7 to 7.2â€‰Â±â€‰6.4) scores increased from pre- to during lockdown (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index was predominantly influenced by sleep-onset latency (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001;â€‰+â€‰29.8%), sleep efficiency (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001;â€‰âˆ’â€‰21.1%), and total sleep time (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001;â€‰âˆ’â€‰20.1%), whilst Insomnia Severity Index was affected by sleep-onset latency (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001;â€‰+â€‰21.4%), bedtime (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001;â€‰+â€‰9.4%), and eating after midnight (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001;â€‰+â€‰9.1%). During lockdown, athletes reported fewer training sessions per week (âˆ’â€‰29.1%; dâ€‰=â€‰0.99). Athletes went to bed (+â€‰75 min; 5.4%; dâ€‰=â€‰1.14) and woke up (+â€‰150 min; 34.5%; dâ€‰=â€‰1.71) later during lockdown with an increased total sleep time (+â€‰48 min; 10.6%; dâ€‰=â€‰0.83). Lockdown-mediated circadian disruption had more deleterious effects on the sleep quality of individual-sport athletes compared with team-sport athletes (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001; dâ€‰=â€‰0.41), elite compared with non-elite athletes (pâ€‰=â€‰0.028; dâ€‰=â€‰0.44) and older compared with younger (pâ€‰=â€‰0.008; dâ€‰=â€‰0.46) athletes.</p>
<p>Conclusions</p>
<p>These lockdown-induced behavioral changes reduced sleep quality and increased insomnia in athletes.

<p>Rivers are among the most threatened ecosystems worldwide and are experiencing rapid biodiversity loss. Flow alteration due to climate change, water abstraction and augmentation is a severe stressor on many aquatic communities. Macroinvertebrates are widely used for biomonitoring river ecosystems although current taxonomic approaches used to characterise ecological responses to flow have limitations in terms of generalisation across biogeographical regions. A new macroinvertebrate trait-based index, Flow-T, derived from ecological functional information (flow velocity preferences) currently available for almost 500 invertebrate taxa at the European scale is presented. The index was tested using data from rivers spanning different biogeographic and hydro-climatic regions from the UK, Cyprus and Italy. The performance of Flow-T at different spatial scales and its relationship with an established UK flow assessment tool, the Lotic-invertebrate Index for Flow Evaluation (LIFE), was assessed to determine the transferability of the approach internationally. Flow-T was strongly correlated with the LIFE index using both presence-absence and abundance weighted data from all study areas (r varying from 0.46 to 0.96). When applied at the river reach scale, Flow-T was effective in identifying communities associated with distinct mesohabitats characterised by their hydraulic characteristics (e.g., pools, riffles, glides). Flow-T can be derived using both presence/absence and abundance data and can be easily adapted to varying taxonomic resolutions. The trait-based approach facilitates research using the entire European invertebrate fauna and can potentially be applied in regions where information on taxa-specific flow velocity preferences is not currently available. The inter-regional and continental scale transferability of Flow-T may help water resource managers gauge the effects of changes in flow regime on instream communities at varying spatial scales.</p>",dataset,['Other earth sciences not elsewhere classified'],"[{'item_id': 20195342, 'grant_title': 'Emilia-Romagna Region and ANBI Emilia-Romagna', 'funder_name': None, 'postDate': '2022-06-30T09:26:00'}, {'item_id': 20195342, 'grant_title': 'Royal Society-Newton International Fellowship at Loughborough University (NIF\\R1\\180346)', 'funder_name': None, 'postDate': '2022-06-30T09:26:00'}]",1,1,7,Comparison Records,102,2022-06-30T09:26:00,1

<p>The COVID-19 pandemic may impact diet and nutrition through increased household food insecurity, lack of access to health services, and poorer quality diets. The primary aim of this study is to assess the impact of the pandemic on dietary outcomes of mothers and their infants and young children (IYC) in low-income urban areas of Peru. We conducted a panel study, with one survey prepandemic (nâ€‰=â€‰244) and one survey 9 months after the onset of COVID-19 (nâ€‰=â€‰254). We assessed breastfeeding and complementary feeding indicators and maternal dietary diversity in both surveys. During COVID-19, we assessed household food insecurity experience and economic impacts of the pandemic on livelihoods; receipt of financial or food assistance, and uptake of health services. Almost all respondents (98.0%) reported adverse economic impacts due to the pandemic and 46.9% of households were at risk of moderate or severe household food insecurity. The proportion of households receiving government food assistance nearly doubled between the two surveys (36.5%â€“59.5%). Dietary indicators, however, did not worsen in mothers or IYC. Positive changes included an increase in exclusive breastfeeding <6 months (24.2%â€“39.0%, pâ€‰<â€‰0.008) and a decrease in sweet food consumption by IYC (33.1%â€“18.1%, pâ€‰=â€‰0.001) and mothers (34.0%â€“14.6%, pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). The prevalence of sugar-sweetened beverage consumption remained high in both mothers (97%) and IYC (78%). In sum, we found dietary indicators had not significantly worsened 9 months into the COVID-19 pandemic. However, several indicators remain suboptimal and should be targeted in future interventions.Â </p>",dataset,[],"[{'item_id': 20079890, 'grant_title': 'STAMINA: Strategies to Mitigate Nutritional Risks among mothers and infants under 2 years in low income urban households in Peru during COVID-19', 'funder_name': 'Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council', 'postDate': '2022-06-16T13:23:00'}, {'item_id': 20079890, 'grant_title': 'Consejo Nacional de Ciencia, TecnologÃ­a eInnovaciÃ³n TecnolÃ³gica (Concytec) Peru, viaFondo Nacional de Desarrollo CientÃ­fico,TecnolÃ³gico y de InnovaciÃ³n TecnolÃ³gica(Fondecyt), Grant/Award Number: 032â€2019', 'funder_name': None, 'postDate': '2022-06-16T13:23:00'}, {'item_id': 20079890, 'grant_title': 'New strategies to reduce anaemia and risk of overweight and obesity through complementary feeding of infants and young children in Peru', 'funder_name': 'Medical Research Council', 'postDate': '2022-06-16T13:23:00'}]",0,1,7,Comparison Records,156,2022-06-16T13:23:00,1

<p>Background</p>
<p>Sedentary behaviour, physical activity, and psychobiological reactivity to acute psychological stress are independent risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Sedentary behaviour and physical activity influence autonomic, haemodynamic, and inflammatory pathways under resting conditions, and these pathways become activated under acute psychological stress. However, it is unclear whether sedentary behaviour and physical activity relate to psychobiological responses to stress. Thus, the aim of this study is to systematically review sedentary behaviour and physical activity in the context of psychobiological reactivity to acute psychological stress.</p>
<p>Methods</p>
<p>Sedentary behaviour, physical activity and psychobiological stress reactivity search terms were combined, and several databases were searched in duplicate. Eligibility criteria included: (1) a validated measure of sedentary behaviour/physical activity; (2) cardiovascular, inflammatory, neuroendocrine, or respiratory markers measured at rest and in response to laboratory-induced acute psychological stress.</p>
<p>Results</p>
<p>6084 articles were screened, with 11 included in a narrative synthesis. No studies measured postural components of sedentary behaviour, but 2/4 studies found that markers of sedentary behaviour (e.g., physical inactivity) were associated with elevated heart rate, dysregulated heart rate variability, or lowered cortisol responses to stress. Higher volumes of physical activity were linked to lower HR, cortisol, or immune responses to stress in 4/7 studies.</p>
<p>Conclusions</p>
<p>Extensive methodological variability precludes conclusions from being drawn. This review should be used to guide a more homogeneous and gold-standard literature, which accounts for postural components of sedentary behaviour using inclinometery, and the whole physical activity intensity spectrum using universal and reproducible approaches.</p>",dataset,['Other health sciences not elsewhere classified'],"[{'item_id': 20067422, 'grant_title': 'Loughborough University', 'funder_name': None, 'postDate': '2022-06-14T16:09:13'}, {'item_id': 20067422, 'grant_title': 'National Institute for Health Research NIHR Leicester Biomedical Research Centre', 'funder_name': None, 'postDate': '2022-06-14T16:09:13'}]",1,1,7,Comparison Records,150,2022-06-14T16:09:13,1

<p>Existing research has shown that the media can influence public attitudes to immigration. While existing research provides insight into both quantitative and qualitative patterns of media coverage of immigration, research that links such coverage with audience attitudes is almost exclusively quantitative, often focused on the west, and are often single-country studies. We argue that the adoption of a mixed-methods approach to audiences of immigration news, combined with a comparative design and a focus on Eastern Europe â€“ a region scoring lowest in the world in terms of migrant acceptance â€“ can bring significant advances to knowledge in this area, leading to a more rounded understanding of how media come to shape immigration attitudes. To demonstrate this, we draw on a comparative, mixed-methods data set comprising representative population surveys (N=4,092), an expert survey (N=60), and qualitative interviews (N=120) conducted in four Eastern European countries. In contrast to existing research on Western Europe, we found significant variation in the links between attitudes to immigration and use of Public Service Media (PSM), with PSM consumption linked with more negative attitudes to immigration in some countries, and with more positive attitudes in others. Second, our results confirm that different attitudes to immigration are embedded in different qualitative understandings of immigration: while participants with more positive attitudes often adopted a more inclusive understanding of immigration, those with more negative attitudes adopted a narrower understanding. Third, we demonstrated the importance of family and acquaintances as trusted sources of information.Â </p>",dataset,['Sociology not elsewhere classified'],"[{'item_id': 20066618, 'grant_title': 'The Illiberal Turn?

Similar studies are scarcer for other mammals, despite the tremendous potential of serum N-glycans as biomarkers for infectious diseases in animal models of human disease and in the veterinary context. To expand the knowledge of serum N-glycan profiles in important mammalian model systems, in this study, we combined MALDI-TOF-MS analysis and HILIC-UPLC profiling of released N-glycans together with glycosidase treatments to characterize the glycan structures present in rhesus macaque serum. We used this baseline to monitor changes in serum N-glycans during infection with <em>Brugia malayi</em>, a parasitic nematode of humans responsible for lymphatic filariasis, in a longitudinal cohort of infected rhesus macaques. Alterations of the HILIC-UPLC profile, notably of abundant structures, became evident as early as 5Â weeks post-infection. Given its prominent role in the immune response, contribution of immunoglobulin G to serum N-glycans was investigated. Finally, comparison with similar N-glycan profiling performed during infection with the dog heartworm <em>Dirofilaria immitis</em> suggests that many changes observed in rhesus macaque serum N-glycans are specific for lymphatic filariasis.Â </p>",dataset,['Uncategorized'],[],1,0,5,Comparison Records,5,2022-10-21T04:48:28,1

Environmental service workers may be exposed to pathogens during the cleaning of pathogen-containing bodily fluids.
Methods. Participants with experience cleaning hospital environments were asked to clean simulated, fluorescein-containing vomitus using normal practices in a simulated patient room. Fluorescein was visualized in the environment and on participants under black lights.  Fluorescein was quantitatively measured on the floor, in the air, and on gloves and shoe covers.
Results.  In all 21 trials involving seven participants, fluorescein was found on the floor after cleaning and on participantsâ€™ gloves. Lower levels of floor contamination were associated with the use of towels to remove bulk fluid (Ï = -0.56, p = 0.01). Glove contamination was not associated with the number or frequency of contacts with environmental surfaces, suggesting contamination occurs with specific events, such as picking up contaminated towels.  Fluorescein contamination on shoe covers was measured in 19 trials.  Fluorescein was not observed on participantsâ€™ facial personal protective equipment, if worn, or faces.  Contamination on other body parts, primarily the legs, was observed in eight trials. Fluorescein was infrequently quantified in the air. 
Conclusions.  Using towels to remove bulk fluid prior to mopping is part of the recommended cleaning protocol, and should be used to minimize residual contamination.

<p>Simulation studies are used to provide a generic comparison of three approaches to set TACs for a selected stock of each of alfonsino, orange roughy and toothfish in the SIOFA region. These are reduction in the TAC only if there is a high probability of a recent downward trend in the abundance index (APR1), a TAC that fluctuates up or down proportional to recent changes in that index (APR2), and a fitted population model-harvest control rule combination (APR3). To achieve sensible target depletions after 20 years, case-specific selections of initial upward or downward trends in TACs are found to be needed. For technical reasons, the toothfish stock selected proves an unsatisfactory choice for this exercise. Furthermore, results for the orange roughy stock are dominated by the need to reduce current catches substantially to achieve sustainability, rendering comparisons of the approaches problematic. For alfonsino, APR1 is preferred to APR2 because of future TACs show smoother trends in the future; however, consideration of APR3 would need further robustness tests to be investigated to offset its current advantage of equivalence between the testing model and the population model fitted within the procedure. It seems, however, that certain control parameter value choices (especially the size of the initial trend in the TAC) are likely to need to vary substantially from stock to stock, requiring stock-specific as well as generic analyses to proceed further with this investigation. Consequently, the prospects for developing entirely generic approaches/harvest strategies able to cover the major resources in the SIOFA region do not appear promising.Â </p>",presentation,"['Biological mathematics', 'Biostatistics', 'Applied statistics']",[],3,0,8,Comparison Records,27,2022-09-12T06:42:48,1

<p><strong>""â€˜Using the old names anewâ€™: Derek Walcott and Graeco-Roman Antiquity""</strong></p>
<p>In this Speaker Series, Dr Justine McConnell explores the ways in which the St Lucian poet and dramatist, Derek Walcott, winner of the 1992 Nobel Prize for Literature, re-imagines tragedy, epic, and the myths they retell.</p>
<p>Derek Walcott once declared, â€˜What is needed is not new names for old things, or old names for old things, but the faith of using the old names anewâ€™. For Walcott, this is a strategy that â€“ far from signalling a derivative aspect in his writing â€“ nurtures the creation of new work that recasts older forms without being overshadowed by them. Famously, Walcott denied that his book-length poem Omeros was an epic, but he went on to qualify that statement by asking us to rethink what we understand by â€˜epicâ€™. So too, the title of his drama <em>The Isle is Full of Noises</em> evokes Shakespeareâ€™s <em>The Tempest</em>, but the tale it tells is also of a Philoctetes-figure nicknamed Crusoe and the modern exploitation of St Lucia in the name of tourism; and his early play <em>Ione </em>embeds a mashup of several Greek tragedies (Aeschylusâ€™ <em>Agamemnon </em>and <em>Seven Against Thebes</em>, Euripidesâ€™ <em>Medea </em>and <em>The Bacchae</em>) within a context of Caribbean oral storytelling.Â </p>
<p>Contesting the imperial power dynamics European works have often been used to propagate, Walcott contributes to the creation of a new body of Caribbean literature and asserts a place for Caribbean art in a global, transhistorical canon.</p>

<p><em><strong>""Antigone:Â </strong></em><strong>Requiem, Ruin, Revenant</strong><em><strong>""</strong></em>Â </p>
<p>In this Speaker Series, Prof. Christina Wald compared Magnet Theatreâ€™s <em>Antigone (not quite/quiet)</em> to a rewriting of Sophoclesâ€™ tragedy by the Austrian playwright Thomas KÃ¶ck that premiered in the same month.</p>
<p>Both productions can be described as post-dramatic reassemblages of the <em>Antigone </em>material, both link theatre and theory, both use the chorus as a central creative device and employ a strongly rhythmic language. The different adaptation principles of the plays concern their aesthetic as well as political affordances: KÃ¶ckâ€™s title calls his version of <em>Antigone </em>a requiem and a recomposition, while director Mark Fleishman describes the production principle of the collaboratively written and choreographed <em>Antigone (not quite/quiet)</em> as â€˜ruinousâ€™. The politics of the dead are at the centre of both plays and closely connected to their respective colonial histories and postcolonial challenges. In both dramas, the dead return as revenants: In KÃ¶ckâ€™s drama, the dead who are washed ashore the European beach are reanimated, reminding Europe of its colonial history and its responsibility for current migration movements, while in <em>Antigone (not quite/quiet)</em> a chorus of Antigone figures in their tomb embodies the liminal state of South African society. Both plays turn Ismene into a problematic identification figure. While in Magnet Theatreâ€™s production she embodies the white â€˜leftoversâ€™ in South Africa who are haunted by their historical guilt, KÃ¶ckâ€™s Ismene struggles to face her postcolonial responsibility.</p>

The corresponding risk of the anchovy spawner biomass falling below the lowest historical level under OMP-18rev is 6.1%, compared to 3% under a no catch scenario. Anchovy TACs under OMP-18rev are expected to be at the maximum of 350 0000t on average, with a median of 271 000t.

Scientific concepts explained in the first Lecture are extended to their
application, and why this is so dogged by controversy. Much of this is the
result of the â€œtragedy of the commonsâ€ which necessitates placing limits on the
numbers of persons granted access to a fishery, and the consequent problems of
allocation. The international structures for fisheries regulation are
summarised, together with their problems, which include the conflict between
fishing industries and ENGOs, and confusion about responsibilities for science
and for policy. Topical issues of access rights and MPAs are addressed, and
more locally the problems over the impact of poaching on diminishing rock
lobster and abalone stocks, and the extent to which fishing for sardine and
anchovy around penguin colonies may be responsible for the decline in penguin
numbers. The roles of ecolabelling and the courts are discussed, and finally a
set of core questions about the directions the future management of fisheries
may take are posed</p></div>",presentation,"['Applied statistics', 'Biostatistics', 'Biological mathematics']",[],3,0,13,Comparison Records,86,2022-02-02T07:26:43,1

fisheries management are explained by the use of financial analogies. The core
concept of sustainability is illustrated by its correspondence to a pensioner
having to live off the interest on investments and not delve into capital. The
data typically available for fisheries analyses are summarised, with their
weaknesses exposed. Then the basis of how such data are transformed to fishery
catch limit recommendations is summarised, showing how sound advice (robust to uncertainties) can be developed, notwithstanding these data limitations. Finally,
reference is made to a key recent scientific advance in the field (close-kin
genetics), and a brief overview is provided of the status of fisheries management and fish stocks, both globally and in South Africa.<br></p><p></p><p></p>",presentation,"['Applied statistics', 'Biological mathematics', 'Biostatistics']",[],3,0,8,Comparison Records,90,2022-02-02T07:26:12,1

Efforts are now underway around managing our research data as an asset. We can see a national research data system arising, in which researchers, research communities and institutions all play a key role.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Notably, fifteen years ago, when we moved to adopt Research Data Management Plans (RDMPs), there were few institutional, national or commercial services that could support research data life cycles. Today a growing suite of options exist. As such services develop and become commonplace, it is time to rethink â€˜who does whatâ€™.</p>
<p>RDMPs could be reimagined as a map laying out which components of a projectâ€™s data will be directed to which available services. Of course a suitable set of services would need to exist along with an agreement driving their harmonisation and policy coherence. The services would implement life cycle management.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>This BOF brings together several efforts that are underway enabling this trajectory. Each of which is a work in progress that contributes to understanding a future national data system that can support data life cycles at the macro scale.</p>

<p><br></p>
<p>""Invasive Alien Species are non-native animals and plants whose invasions wreak havoc on the environment and societies. A globally notorious alien invader is the cane toad. Wherever it goes, a cane toad brings weapons of environmental destruction â€” poison packed on its shoulders.In Australia, the cane toadâ€™s invasion has poisoned and killed millions of wildlife, pushing them to extinction.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>To aid in the fight against cane toad invasions, I designed <em><strong>virToad </strong></em>â€” a computer simulation game where the playerâ€™s mission is to develop the most efficient and low-cost strategy for controlling cane toad invasions. By playing virToad, wildlife conservationists can make informed management decisions.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>But ultimately, anyone can play virToad, so they can understand and be inspired to join the fight against cane toad invasions and conserve our wildlife.""</p>

AGEs are generated during the production of highly processed food, some of which are gastrointestinally absorbed during consumption of these foods. In normal amount, it can be excreted automatically through urine. However, if we have high AGE in our body, the AGEs will accumulate in the body tissue and may cause inflammation. If they accumulate in the lining of the uterus, the lining becomes inflamed. So that a fertilised egg cannot implant into the lining. AGEs in the uterus negatively impact endometrial function and prevent embryo implantation, potentially contributing to the increased rate of infertility observed in obese women.Â </p>

<p>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) provides the most accurate medical images inside the human body and is often utilized by radiologists in the clinical setting to search for abnormalities, make diagnoses, and recommend treatment options. However, the scan time in MRI can easily exceed 30 minutes which leads to low patient throughput, problems with patient comfort and compliance, artifacts from patient motion, and high exam costs. In our research, we employ Artificial Intelligence (AI) to reduce the scan time of MRI. This would be beneficial not only to patients in critical conditions but also to vulnerable groups such as pregnant women, elderly persons, small children, persons suffering from special conditions such as Parkinson's disease, Claustrophobia, etc. Achieving faster scan times will also increase throughputs and reduce complications in resource allocation in regional areas where the accessibility to MRI scanners is scarce. Our methodology involves combining MRI physics with AI to build deep learning models which could produce high-quality MR images given undersampled raw MRI measurements as input. The outputs of our research will fundamentally reduce risks and costs in MRI.</p>",presentation,[],[],0,0,24,Comparison Records,1026,2022-08-08T04:26:52,1

Based on this, the combination of TMZ and Kisspeptin showed to further reduce the cell viability of GBM cells more than the TMZ single treatment, while kisspeptin treatment did not affect GBM cell viability when treated solo. Moreover, my study in diving into understanding the mechanism of action this combination is working through. Elucidation of possible mechanism(s) may provide the essential information to further justify the potential therapeutic avenue of repurposing kisspeptin in GBM treatment.

<h3>Online; f2f; both; together?! How has your teaching changed in 2022?</h3>
<h3>Thursday 9 June, 1.00 â€“ 2.30 pm AEST</h3>
<p>Over the last two years, many of us crafted new ways of teaching to deliver essential services to our clients/patrons. Itâ€™s time to reflect on these and explore how our teaching has changed in 2022 with the return to campus, return to face to face services, and with consideration to what is happening in university lectures and workshops.<br>
</p>
<p>In this online forum, we heard from each CAVAL member library about how they are managing the expectations of clients - and the needs of staff - when teaching classes to a range of audiences.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Activities in facilitated breakout rooms encouraged the audience to share their experiences throughout the forum as well.</p>
<h3>Get Oriented!</h3>
<p>Quickly moving our 'Get to know your Library' Orientation sessions from f2f to online required the collaborative effort and expertise of teams from across the library. This resulted in interactive, informative sessions underpinned by student-centred approaches. Feedback gathered from participants has informed the ongoing development of Library Orientation, resulting in a creative and successful online model we continue to use today. We share the challenges, benefits and opportunities, including the learnings gained for staff and students alike.</p>

This means that all circuits currently in production have an intrinsic resistance and generate heat when current flows through them. This heating effect may only be small in laptops and phones, but when scaled up to industrial-sized data centres, the results are tangible. Data centres produce enough heat that they generate their own microclimates. To combat the significant effects that this heating has on global warming, we need to invest in zero-resistance (dissipationless) devices. My research is investigating polaritons, particles formed of light and matter that are strong candidates for the realisation of dissipationless technology. </div><div><br></div><div>For more information, please contact <a href=""mailto:mitko.oldfield@monash.edu"" target=""_blank"">mitko.oldfield@monash.edu</a><br></div><div>All work not cited is my own.</div>",presentation,"['Condensed matter imaging', 'Condensed matter physics not elsewhere classified', 'Electronic and magnetic properties of condensed matter; superconductivity', 'Nonlinear optics and spectroscopy', 'Foundations of quantum mechanics']",[],5,0,21,Comparison Records,2535,2021-08-25T23:10:18,1

Potential economic gains and cost savings from</div><div>circular business models have been mentioned as drivers to implement circular thinking within</div><div>organisations.

In the Management Science literature, a significant attention has been devoted to CLSC network design problems, which are aimed at providing decision support for ensuring the appropriate configuration of supply chains. </p><p>In this research, a careful scrutiny of the identified body of literature is performed, focusing on CLSC network design problems. The review analyses the following elements: (i) the type of decision supported (strategic, tactical or operational); (ii) the coverage of the different sustainability dimensions (economic, environmental, social) within the field of study; (iii) the adoption of different modelling (e.g., deterministic vs stochastic) and solution (e.g., exact methods vs heuristic/meta-heuristic ones); (iv) the applicability of the developed approaches to real-world cases and different types of supply chains. </p><p>While the literature in this field is abundant, several gaps can be identified. One of the most notable one is the lack of rigorous assessment of the integration of economic, environmental and social sustainability performances within CLSC network design problems. Indeed, in existing researches, the social dimension of sustainability is seldom evaluated; also, the environmental dimension is generally measured in generic ways (C0<sub>2</sub> emissions) and not through a rigorous account of the degree of circularity of the devised configurations. Moreover, the integration of strategic, tactical and operational decisions has been scarcely studied as well. This paper will report about these gaps and propose a related research agenda.</p>",presentation,"['Logistics', 'Supply chains']","[{'item_id': 13663589, 'grant_title': 'Realising the Transition to the Circular Economy: Models, Methods and Applications', 'funder_name': 'European Commission', 'postDate': '2021-02-02T12:14:35'}]",2,0,7,Comparison Records,289,2021-02-02T12:14:35,1

Coherently to a free-market scenario, these directives openly recognise a very important role for existing organisations, which, through bottom-up initiatives, shall drive the transition towards the Circular Economy in supply chains. In the European context, several companies (both SMEs and MNEs) claim to have changed, over the last years, the way they operate, by adopting Circular Economy practices. Such interventions have emphasised product and material reuse and recycle and the use of renewable energy sources throughout supply chains (Genovese et al., 2017). However, the actual extent to which Circular Economy principles are operationalised and the real impact of legislation changes have yet to be investigated (Stewart & Niero, 2018), especially when dealing with large Multi-National Enterprises, which have been operating, for decades, according to a very traditional linear model. As such, this study aims at assessing the Circular Economy state-of-the-practice in a structured way, by classifying all the initiatives that can be recognised in the largest European companies by revenues, according to the Global Fortune 500 list (fiscal year 2018). Key findings of the underlying research include an evaluation of the type of practices and of their degree of implementation, of the metrics employed to measure their impacts, along with the level of involvement of supply chain partners in such practices.",presentation,"['Logistics', 'Supply chains']","[{'item_id': 13655873, 'grant_title': 'Realising the Transition to the Circular Economy: Models, Methods and Applications', 'funder_name': 'European Commission', 'postDate': '2021-01-28T23:10:47'}]",2,0,6,Comparison Records,335,2021-01-28T23:10:47,1

While we recognise much policy happens in â€˜local placesâ€™ (e.g. through commissioning PH services), we will discuss how our recent review work highlights the substantive role of policy action at central executive (parliamentary/assembly) level in all UK countries in addressing wider determinants of early child development. Influencing at this central level is an important opportunity for public health practitioners, yet securing central-level political action often requires (amongst other things) coalitions of stakeholders who share similar beliefs, collectively identify with one another, and collectively try to frame dialogue, use evidence and advocate in ways that resonate with policy makers and the public. Drawing on the conclusions, we will ask the audience whether they think this type of coalition or collective public health identity exists within or across the UK PH workforce?

In general, pollinator biodiversity has been decreasing over time globally due to factors such as agricultural intensification, urbanization, climate change, and other anthropological activities. The purpose of our study is to investigate the potential ability of the University of Arizona to serve as a pollinator â€œbiodiversity hotspotâ€ in an urban landscape. We used community science data from two sources, iNaturalist and the USA National Phenology Network, to analyze the relative presence, diversity, and change over time of pollinators on the university campus compared with the surrounding urban area. The results from this study will help us better understand pollinator activity, employ conservation methods, and potentially increase their frequency on campus through thoughtful management and restoration practices including a digital pollinator field guide.<br><br></p><hr><br><br><i>For inquiries regarding the contents of this dataset, please contact the Corresponding Author listed in the README.txt file.

Image calibration removes noise and is important for drawing scientific conclusions from the images. Charge smear is a common source of noise for frame transfer detectors; although the current method of charge smear correction is acceptable, it requires an additional correction factor that takes time to find and has some uncertainty. We tested several techniques to address these factors and ultimately implemented an optimization function that has been shown to increase the accuracy and efficiency of the charge smear correction. The primary benefit of this work is improved calibration of OCAMS images, but it also demonstrates a discrepancy between the theoretical and experimental correction. Further investigation into this discrepancy might improve our understanding of the physical and electronic characteristics that affect the detectorâ€™s physical operation.</div><br><hr><br><i>For inquiries regarding the contents of this dataset, please contact the Corresponding Author listed in the README.txt file.

This will be used in the CatSat project to predict and analyze an experiment satellite-to-ground propagation effects. Equations to predict these ionospheric effects were derived starting with the satelliteâ€™s orbit, ground station location, and Total Electron Content (TEC), assuming a spherical Earth, a dipole magnetic field, and a non-varying thin Ionosphere.

It is known that the Moon had a dynamo magnetic field, but it is not certain what the magnetized material consists of. The orbital magnetometer data were used to create maps, which will allow better modeling and interpretation of the magnetic anomalies. Correlations with surface geology will help to distinguish between sources such as impact ejecta containing iron from the impactors that created large craters on the Moon. Modeling can determine directions of magnetization, which indicate the orientation of the dynamo magnetic field when the magnetized material was first formed. The location of the magnetic pole at the time it was formed can be estimated if the magnetizing field was generated in the Moonâ€™s iron core.<br></div><div><div><br></div><div><hr></div><div><br></div><div><i>For inquiries regarding the contents of this dataset, please contact the Corresponding Author listed in the README.txt file.

This deformation is known as glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA). The GIA is critical to understanding the rate of uplift of the rockbed which contributes to sea-level changes, flexure response of surrounding rockbed, and understanding the rheology of the mantle. This project contributes to current knowledge of how GIA uplift will change going into the future. Greenland has had significant ice mass loss since 2003 and ongoing GIA deformation since LGM. Slepian functions and GRACE gravity data were used to calculate the ice mass loss in Greenland to construct a forward model of the GIA for Greenland based on the next 100 years of ice loss. This is important for finding when the GIA signal will have a comparable value to GIA from earlier deglaciation periods.<br></div><div><div><br></div><div><hr></div><div><br></div><div><i>For inquiries regarding the contents of this dataset, please contact the Corresponding Author listed in the README.txt file.

One
such measurement is the chemical content produced by stars. It is a fossilized record of cumulative star formation
that is impacted by gas inflows and outflows. Driven by these insights, my NASA Space Grant project focused on
constructing a stellar mass--chemical abundance relation for high-redshift galaxies. Contrary to previous work, my
analyses derive chemical abundances using more robust measurements sensitive to the gas temperature. This makes
it one of the first extragalactic studies to do so for the early universe. Specifically, we use the [OIII]4363 emission
line and implement a spectral stacking approach to increase the detection signal for this weak emission line. With
stacks for different stellar mass bins, our preliminary results illustrate that a correlation exists between stellar mass
and chemical abundance for high-redshift galaxies.<div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><hr></div><div><br></div><div><i>For inquiries regarding the contents of this dataset, please contact the Corresponding Author listed in the README.txt file.

We can understand the physics of galaxy evolution by constraining their heavy element abundances. Current studies of distant galaxies utilize â€œstrong-line diagnosticsâ€ to determine these abundances. These measurements are not accurate as they are calibrated with nearby galaxies, which differ from galaxies seen in the early universe. One method for solving this problem is to study â€œR23â€ and â€œO32â€ strong-line diagnostics for distant galaxies and calibrate them to a direct metallicity indicator, [OIII]Î»4363. This project analyzes DEEP2 Survey data with the goal of detecting this emission line. We explored different binning approaches to find the best technique to obtain optimal signal-to-noise for stacked spectra. Detections in eight of fourteen composites allow us to calculate average electron temperatures and metallicities. Preliminary results from this project will be presented using regression techniques to relate â€œR23â€ and â€œO32â€ against metallicity.</div><div><br></div><div>

Abstract: Various stakeholders in the complex healthcare systems often prioritise and pursue different purposes, values and outcomes. Understanding/sharing/negotiating the trade-offs between them is a critical action in the development and design of complex healthcare systems. Some
approaches like work domain analysis or soft systems methodology attempted to map the complex interactions, but it remains unclear how those maps and visualisations are in line with how people conceptualise in practice. This study aims to explore how designers visualise complex system interactions using healthcare outcomes to define the purpose. A workshop was conducted with 23 designers to generate outcome-based visualisations. The results indicate that designers conceptualise the purpose of the healthcare systems in different ways. Complexity was expressed
through organic circles and messy arrows. However, support elements are needed to conduct open visualisations. These results may play a role in developing a visualisation-based method to address the complexity of purpose definition in healthcare.",presentation,[],[],0,0,1,Comparison Records,554,2020-03-20T14:54:48,1

For the Summer Palaceâ€™s directors to create exceptional experiences, exhibition designers must understand how to tell stories that have great meaning to the Summer Palaceâ€™s national and international visitors. Our research targets this question â€“ we propose developing innovative and unique storytelling methods through interactive exhibitions throughout the Summer Palace to suspend the visitorâ€™s sense of reality; increasing their sense of flow, suggestion, and engagement. We suggest the Summer Palace for this research project due to its status as a UNESCO World Heritage Site seeking to increase its international reputation. If directors and exhibition designers understand how advanced technology, including immersive exhibitions and augmented reality, can meet educational, enjoyment, and emotional needs of the Summer Palaceâ€™s diverse visitors during festivals and tourist visits, we may increase existing visitorâ€™s engagement, and capture new tourist groups - who previously ignored the Palace. We hope our work shall ultimately contribute to making the Summer Palace Chinaâ€™s foremost Cultural Heritage Site and festival epicentre. <br>",presentation,"['Design not elsewhere classified', 'Heritage, archive and museum studies not elsewhere classified']",[],2,1,8,Comparison Records,532,2019-08-09T08:52:48,1

products are defined as the devices, items or systems whether acquired
commercially, modified or customised that are aimed to enhance, improve or
maintain functional capabilities of an individuals living with some form of
disability. The AT market is growing internationally, as the number of elderly
and individual with disabilities is increasing. Like mainstream products, the use
of AT products does not occur in vacuum but happens in a socio-cultural environment,
where those products communicate the intended message of their designer. </p>

<p>On the other hand, culture is an
important variable when considering the communication of meaning through an
artefact. Meanwhile, evidences from literature has highlighted distinct
differences in the cognitive processing that delivers perception between individuals
from collectivistic and individualistic societies.  Little is published about how cultural
differences in cognition relate to the semantic preferences of a AT product
attributes and their users. </p>

The lecture highlights the scope of the issues facing those with impairment or disability within current UK society; the challenges facing designers in this field relating to user acceptance of AT products provided; and, the associated stigma. The reasons behind the lack of social acceptance for Assistive Technology (AT) products are explored through values, beliefs and doctrines. The context of AT products are defined within a user-centred new product development (NPD) process. The viewpoint of the user, associated stakeholders and a wider UK society are described, along with their associated preferences. The generic mechanisms of perception and emotional response to a product are discussed and mapped onto the given process. The semantics of words images and forms are shown to be critical influences on the perception of an individual and society. The lecture provides an example process and design tools that has been practically applied through many successful AT product developments. Further examples of current Finalist student product designs will demonstrate some of the principles described. The process described uses a combination of conventional evidenced-based NPD alongside specific methods of the manipulation of perception and semantic meaning. Design tools such as value web-diagrams, technology footprint, iconography and product DNA are demonstrated within the NPD examples.

<p>Abstract: Archival collections come in all sizes, formats, and subjects, and it is impossible for any archival education program to cover all situations that professional archivists encounter. Most arrangement and description standards work best when applied to collections of a certain size; other collections pose unique challenges that lie beyond the scope of these standards. Plans can (and often do) change as collections are processed and as researchers and others put them to use. This panel will discuss strategies and techniques for processing large and small collections on both macro and micro levels and their long-term impact on users. We will draw on our experiences with manuscript and records collections of varying sizes to discuss the use of MPLP and other processing techniques and share some of our methods for dealing with the nitty-gritty details of everyday processing. Proper planning is essential to processing and paramount when a collection comprises hundreds of linear feet, yet it is often difficult to develop and implement processing plans when drawing on your experience alone. This session will be useful to all archivists staring down their own unprocessed backlogs and prospective archivists curious about the daily work behind that ever-nebulous term â€œprocessing.â€</p>",presentation,['Library and Information Studies'],[],1,0,3,Comparison Records,58,2022-07-27T03:45:27,1

Although most women are tested at ANC, they remain at risk for HIV exposure and transmission to their infant when their partners are not tested. This study evaluates how an HIV-enhanced and Centering-based group ANC model-Group ANC+ that uses interactive learning to practice partner communication is associated with improvements in partner HIV testing during pregnancy. METHODS: A randomized pilot study conducted in Malawi and Tanzania found multiple positive outcomes for pregnant women (nÂ =â€‰218) assigned to Group ANC+ versus individual ANC. This analysis adds previously unpublished results for two late pregnancy outcomes: communication with partner about three reproductive health topics (safer sex, HIV testing, and family planning) and partner HIV testing since the first antenatal care visit. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to assess the effect of type of ANC on partner communication and partner testing. We also conducted a mediation analysis to assess whether partner communication mediated the effect of type of care on partner HIV testing. RESULTS: Nearly 70% of women in Group ANC+ reported communicating about reproductive health with their partner, compared to 45% of women in individual ANC. After controlling for significant covariates, women in group ANC were twice as likely as those in individual ANC to report that their partner got an HIV test (OR 1.99; 95% CI: 1.08, 3.66). The positive effect of the Group ANCâ€‰+â€‰model on partner HIV testing was fully mediated by increased partner communication. CONCLUSIONS: HIV prevention was included in group ANC health promotion without compromising services and coverage of standard ANC topics, demonstrating that local high-priority health promotion needs can be integrated into ANC using a Group ANC+. These findings provide evidence that greater partner communication can promote healthy reproductive behaviors, including HIV prevention. Additional research is needed to understand the processes by which group ANC allowed women to discuss sensitive topics with partners and how these communications led to partner HIV testing.",presentation,['Uncategorized'],[],1,0,36,Comparison Records,114,2022-02-11T17:20:33,1

The  PVDG  is  usually  integrated  to  distribution  systems.  The  integration of PVDG can alleviate energy demand effectively while  reduce  air  pollution  and  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  However, with the increasing integration, the PVDG systems inevitably  lead  to  significant  challenges  on  operation  of  power systems, including protection of distribution systems. In  the  existing  literature,  only  a  few  papers  discussed  the  impact  of  the  integration  of  PVDG  on  the  protection  of  distribution   systems,   and   the   corresponding   technical   challenges  are  not  fully  clarified.  To  fill  the  gap,  this  paper  develops a generic distribution system with the integration of a PVDG system to analyze the impact of integration of PVDG on the overcurrent protection of the distribution system. It is found  that  the  control  of  PV  inverters  can  limit  the  fault  current  significantly  during  a  short-circuit  (SC)  fault.  This  makes the SC current of the faulted feeder too low to trigger the  circuit  breaker,  leading  to  a  protection  failure  (should  operate but does not). To verify this conclusion, a comparison case   with   the   connection   of   a   traditional   synchronous   generator is provided in this paper.",presentation,['Uncategorized'],[],1,0,5,Comparison Records,121,2021-09-08T16:49:19,1

However, the chemical engineering curriculum has not evolved at the same pace. Thus, the gap between industry needs and competencies developed in chemical engineering (CHE) programs has grown. To adequately address this problem, the authorsâ€™ goal is to synergize industry-student-academia and to enculturate classrooms with industry. Implementation of this model is particularly essential in the early years of the curriculum. As the first step, the authors aim to design and incorporate up-to-date industry problems into â€œMaterials and Energy Balanceâ€ as a course assignment. The authors of this paper have been working with industry mentors from various areas of the chemical engineering field to design up-to-date application-based problems/projects for the selected CHE class. Five industrial mentors with different areas of expertise were selected. One industrial mentor is chosen particularly from process safety experts to integrate safety into the course. The sustainability of this model is dependent on understanding the gain and challenges of industry mentors. Thus, industry mentors are interviewed prior to and following the faculty-industry mentorship to determine the challenges and gains. This study describes these efforts and the data collected. Based on the data collected and analyses, challenges, and gains are identified. The findings of this study help to reveal the effective principles of industrial engagement for the evolving field of chemical engineering. The knowledge gained provide insights regarding important aspects of industry-faculty engagement and establish best practices. The results can help other institutions to build and maintain industry-faculty relationships.",presentation,['Uncategorized'],"[{'item_id': 15131076, 'grant_title': 'Research Initiation - Developing Professional Identity: Integrating Academic and Workplace Competencies within Engineering Programs', 'funder_name': 'Directorate for Engineering', 'postDate': '2021-09-03T20:36:01'}]",1,0,1,Comparison Records,111,2021-09-03T20:36:01,1

Fitch expects to resolve the Rating Watch within the next six months based on an assessment of the stateâ€™s fiscal trajectory as it starts fiscal 2018. If the state continues on the current path, a further downgrade would be warranted. Illinois has failed to capitalize on the economic growth of recent years to bolster its financial position. Rather, the decision to allow temporary tax increases to expire and the subsequent failure to develop a budget that aligns revenues with expenditures have resulted in a marked deterioration in the stateâ€™s finances during this time of recovery. Once again, the state has displayed an unwillingness to utilize its extensive control over revenues and spending to address numerous fiscal challenges.</div><div><br></div>",presentation,['Uncategorized'],[],1,0,9,Comparison Records,125,2021-08-02T14:27:51,1

Once used to synthesize visual textures, the program popularized the concept of neural network training through image classification algorithms, inspiring visual art interrogating machine learning and the training of proprietary prediction algorithms; though DeepDream has facilitated the production of many mundane examples of surreal computer art, it has also helped to produce some conceptually rich visual investigations, including computational artist Memo Aktenâ€™s multi-channel series of films We Are All Connected, and MacArthur Fellow Trevor Paglenâ€™s exhibition A Study of Invisible Images. While the significance of trained neural networks is presently considered valuable to computer vision experimentation, a medial archeological investigation of machine learning reveals the fundamental influence early sonic experiments in computational music have in its computational and conceptual framework. Early computational music works, such as Lejaren Hiller Jr. and Leonard Isaacsonâ€™s Illiac Suite (1957), the first score composed by a computer, as well as Hiller and John Cageâ€™s ambitious multimedia performance HPSCHD (1969), used stochastic models to automate game-like processes, such as Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrinaâ€™s Renaissance-era polyphonic instruction, as well as the I Ching divination process of casting coins or yarrow stalks. Hiller's concerns regarding the historical use of compositional/mathematical gameplay uncovers a conceptual and performative emphasis anticipating the â€œtrainingâ€ of visual models. Through the adverse reactions of audiences to Hillerâ€™s compositions, written by what the press deemed derogatorily â€œAn electronic brainâ€ in 1957 parallel public reactions to the disturbing mutations of DeepDream, popular participation in the open-source project signals a growing willingness to collaborate creatively with computers to interrogate both computational and cognitive processes.",presentation,['Uncategorized'],[],1,0,1,Comparison Records,101,2021-06-24T21:50:37,1

Methods: Rural student physicians were loaned the iPad mini for a seven-month long rural medicine rotation. A mixed methodology for evaluation included using pre/post surveys and structured learning journal prompts.  To analyze the success of this program, pre- and post-surveys were implemented at the beginning and end of the rotation using the validated Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) instrument. The students were asked to participate in structured learning journal prompts sent to them every three weeks during their rural placement allowing the investigators to gain insight of the use of the resources and the iPad device. The structured learning prompts were developed with an action research approach, using previous feedback from the prompts to develop new questions for student feedback. Thematic coding and analysis were carried out by two reviewers to identify resource use, task performance and participant reflection within the structured learning journals (SLJs).

Results: Nine students enrolled in the program with five having completed the rotation with the iPad mini to date; two students dropped out and two students are expected to finish in June 2017.  The students reported using the device either daily or several times a week. Data gathered using the thematic coding of the SLJs and pre- and post-surveys show a consistent use of the device on the rural rotation for accessing information, answering clinical questions, sharing information with their rural preceptor, and studying for examinations.  The resources or clinical information tools reported by the students prior to the rural rotation were used during the rotation and several students reported exploration and adoption of new evidence-based information resources.  Participants also described several opinions on the implementing of the program within the rural environment, which allowed the investigators to modify the program for new participants.

Conclusion: The assessment informed the researchers by showing the information-seeking behavior in a rural environment and acceptance of new technology into the participantsâ€™ workflow.  With use of the iPad minis and resources, students were able to access essential clinical information and test prep material, adding to their educational experience within their rural student physician training.",presentation,['Uncategorized'],"[{'item_id': 10781906, 'grant_title': 'This project has been funded in whole or in part with Federal Funds from the National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Services, under Contract No. HHSN-276-2011-00005C with the University of Illinois at Chicago', 'funder_name': None, 'postDate': '2018-06-29T00:00:00'}]",1,0,5,Comparison Records,237,2017-05-28T00:00:00,1

There are several ways of defining ""user experience"" to various physical and virtual spaces and services that a library may want to evaluate.  For libraries, this can mean analyzing how users interact with your website to improve your virtual presence, observing users to improve your physical space, or interviewing how users research to improve services and instruction.

The lure of instant access to digital content can attract the attention of donors and patrons. However, film digitization projects face potential pitfalls such as complicated rights issues, high costs due to the need for specialized handling procedures and labor intensive cataloging. The lack of clear preservation format standards for video content creates a preservation risk. A project at Old Dominion University to digitize a collection of five thousand 16mm newsreel films dated 1940-1980 will be used to discuss these issues. The collection contains some 35,000 individual stories that were shown on WTAR-TV in Norfolk Virginia and created by local and national vendors, some of which are defunct. Because of the difficulty of determining ownership of the physical collection and its intellectual property rights, the films remained unused in a university storeroom for 10 years. Publicity about writing a grant to digitize the collection has brought requests from local public school systems and libraries to use the collection in their own digital content delivery systems. These partnerships could substantially broaden use of the collection but raise intellectual property issues. Strategies to avoid these pitfalls are discussed.",presentation,['Uncategorized'],[],1,0,5,Comparison Records,184,2014-06-01T00:00:00,1

Methods: A survey was designed and pre-tested before distribution.  From May to July 2009, an email invitation to the survey was sent to over twenty health sciences librarians or association listservs. Participants were asked questions regarding their former health sciences careers, their reasons for switching careers, their impressions of librarianship, and their health sciences background impact on their current career.  

Results: There were a total of 274 responses to the survey.  The health sciences profession with the most responses was nursing. Over 26% of the respondents decided to change careers between one to five years of working as health sciences professionals.  The majority of respondents have been working as librarians between 6 to 10 years and most are satisfied with their career move.   Over 23% of the respondents still think of themselves as health sciences professionals.  Most of the responses indicated that they felt they were treated differently by patrons and their colleagues because of their health sciences background.  Although over 61% of respondents were members of MLA, only 16% were AHIP members.   
 
Conclusions:   Librarians with health sciences backgrounds are satisfied with their career move.   They feel that their background gives them an advantage in certain areas such as teaching and research.",presentation,['Uncategorized'],[],1,0,3,Comparison Records,143,2010-05-01T00:00:00,1

To evaluate libraries nursing collections for how their resources align with the Interagency Council on Information Resources in Nursing (ICIRN) Essential Nursing Resources list.

Background

The ICIRN has maintained a biennial list of nursing resources since 1967. This list includes both free and subscription-based books, databases, and websites.  The Essential Nursing Resources 26th edition was released as online only for the first time in 2012.  

Methods

To build a list of library websites with nursing collections, a random sample of over 200 nursing programs was created from 559 Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education accredited schools.  Librariesâ€™ collections were compared to free and subscription-based resources from the following categories: Complementary and Alternative Medicine, Consumer Health and Patient Education, Databases and Indexes, Drugs, and Evidence-Based Nursing.  Resources included databases and government resources such as National Library of Medicine resources.  Print resources were excluded.  The results were recorded on an online survey tool called Qualtrics.  

Results
	
The results section will include information on the colleges with accredited nursing programs such as the type of institution based on the Carnegie Classifications and the level of nursing degree.  It will also indicate which versions of CINAHL and MEDLINE libraries use and resources not on the Essential Nursing Resources that were on the librariesâ€™ websites.  

Conclusions

This presentation is the first time the Essential Nursing Resources has been used as the basis for an evaluation study of librariesâ€™ nursing collections.",presentation,['Uncategorized'],[],1,0,4,Comparison Records,225,2013-10-01T00:00:00,1

Setting/Participants/Resources:  The University of Illinois at Chicago, Library of the Health Sciences â€“ Rockford
Brief Description:  Library instruction is one of the most important services provided by librarians.  Traditional hands-on sessions in a computer laboratory is still an effective and common method of teaching.  Training sessions on a different online database were offered on the fourth Wednesday of the month.  The objective was to instill a habit for learning to the library users by offering classes on the same day every month.   A schedule of classes was developed and implemented.  The sessions were advertised by displaying flyers and distributing emails throughout the month highlighting the database-of-the-month.        
Results/Outcome:  Offering library instruction classes on a regularly scheduled day each month provided the opportunity to develop a habit of coming into the library to learn a new database every month.
Evaluation Method:  Attendance was tabulated to determine the success of the sessions.",presentation,['Uncategorized'],"[{'item_id': 10959866, 'grant_title': 'Midwest Chapter/Medical Library Association', 'funder_name': None, 'postDate': '2009-06-18T00:00:00'}]",1,0,2,Comparison Records,168,2008-10-20T00:00:00,1

In many cases, elongate, finger-like geometries emerge from the outer margin of these planar sheet intrusions during magma migration through the Earthâ€™s crust. Previous field studies and both analogue and numerical experiments suggest that magma finger emplacement is dominated by either i) fracture propagation (mode I failure), ii) shear failure (mode II failure), or iii) viscous deformation (e.g., host rock fluidisation). In this study, we present field-based data collected at the outer margin of the Paleogene Shonkin Sag laccolith, Montana, USA, to evaluate how host rocks (Cretaceous Eagle sandstone) deform to accommodate magma finger emplacement. We combine unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV or drone) photogrammetry surveys with field observations to map and quantify host rock deformation and to assess whether or not magma finger emplacement can be described by a single end-member process.</p><p> </p><p>Our field observations show that magma finger emplacement at the outer margin of the Shonkin Sag laccolith was accommodated by all three proposed end-member models. We predominantly observe brittle deformation, folding and shear failure between adjacent magma fingers, whereas evidence for host rock fluidisation is mainly observed at the cross-sectional lateral tips of magma fingers and to a minor extent at the top and bottom intrusion-host rock contacts. Preliminary results of photogrammetric analyses suggest that overburden strata uplift due to magma finger inflation accommodates up to 20% of the intrusion thickness. It is important to note, that we often observe all three modes of deformation mechanism in the same outcrop at metre scale and in some cases associated with a single magma finger. This metre-scale variation of host rock deformation indicates that magma finger emplacement is likely accommodated by multiple deformation mechanisms.</p><p> </p><p>We conclude that host rock fluidisation in combination with brittle, ductile and elastic deformation accommodated magma emplacement at the outer margin of the Shonkin Sag laccolith. We further hypothesise magma fingers were potentially initiated due to host rock fluidisation and resulting viscous fingering. The propagation and growth in length, however, might be dominated by i) fracture propagation, ii) viscous indentation, and/or iii) host rock fluidisation, highlighting that emplacement mechanisms might change during magma emplacement. We relate brittle deformation, folding, and shear failure between adjacent magma fingers to a compressional regime that forms once fingers grow in width, resulting in host rock shortening and thickening.</p>",poster,"['Geology not elsewhere classified', 'Structural geology and tectonics', 'Volcanology']","[{'item_id': 13524530, 'grant_title': 'ARC Discovery Grant DP190102422', 'funder_name': None, 'postDate': '2021-01-06T09:56:42'}]",3,0,7,Comparison Records,282,2021-01-06T09:56:42,1

In contrast to other parallelisation techniques, it can be applied to a broad class of learning algorithms without further mathematical derivations and without writing dedicated code, while at the same time maintaining theoretical performance guarantees. Moreover, our parallelisation scheme is able to reduce the runtime of many learning algorithms to polylogarithmic time on quasi-polynomially many processing units. This is a significant step towards a general answer to an open question on efficient parallelisation of machine learning algorithms in the sense of Nick's Class (NC). The cost of this parallelisation is in the form of a larger sample complexity. Our empirical study confirms the potential of our parallelisation scheme with fixed numbers of processors and instances in realistic application scenarios.",poster,['Knowledge representation and reasoning'],[],1,0,5,Comparison Records,588,2020-08-20T02:48:56,1

human health. Despite the volume of experiments performed and data 
available, its biology is not yet fully understood. Functional omics 
technologies such as high throughput sequencing and mass spectrometry 
allow users to capture large quantities of complex data. From these 
individual data modalities, it is possible to extract valuable 
information associated with a biological system under study, leading to 
new discoveries and a deeper knowledge of biology. However, combining 
these blocks of information can yield information that is not visible

take a multi-omics integrative view of the data, combining both 
proteomics and translatome data. This is in contrast to existing studies
 which mostly focus on a single aspect of functional omics data, 
primarily the genome. As a result of this fragmented view, valuable 
information may be masked. Using a latent variable approach, our 
integrative pipeline unifies proteome and translatome. We compared the 
features of interest contributing to each biological outcome across the 
individual data blocks and the integrated omics data. This revealed 
previously invisible and potentially medically relevant features for

This project was created to manage and redevelop the TMC.  This collection has been a challenge primarily because it sits outside of the general and special collections practices of the University library system. The TMC has sat unchanged and under-utilised for many years.  This project began as a way of addressing these underlying issues, and to promote these resources to the Faculty of Education staff. The long term goal of this collection redevelopment is to better inform and support the teaching and learning practices of students undertaking undergraduate and postgraduate qualifications in early childhood, primary, and secondary teaching practice.   </div><div><br></div><div>The library team has reviewed best practices and evaluated our current resources in the field, as part of this project over the past year.  Our aim is to develop a collection that is inclusive, and reflective of current and future teaching practices that adopts a holistic, progressive and agile approach to resource management. We look to achieve this through collaboration with stakeholders within the library and University faculties, and the integration of technology and other modern educational resources that are relevant to the development of the skills that students will need to prepare them for employment in both traditional and increasingly digital environments. </div><div><br></div><div>The collection has been benchmarked against comparative collections at other tertiary institutions and local school libraries.  Moreover, library staff collaborated with academics to embed resources within their unit curriculum, review collection resources and create work integrated learning programs to explicitly tie skill development to library resources. We have looked for ways to integrate best practice into the TMC, and develop procedures specifically for this specialised collection. The goal of this project is to create an innovative collection through a review of the literature and comparative collections, to develop a set of flexible procedures that will allow the library to respond to changes in the curriculum and professional outcomes.  While overall, making both traditional teaching resources and digital technologies available to all students.  Where these resources are more accessible and relevant to students who will be teaching in a twenty-first century classroom. </div><div>While this project is ongoing, the redevelopment of this collection and the acquired resources will endeavour to make both traditional teaching resources and digital technologies available to all students through an open and accessible collection. </div><div><br></div><div>CONFERENCE CONCEPT</div><div>Technology and social good through open and accessible collections.</div></div><div><br></div>

newly arrived refugees have initial health care needs met within
refugee-focused health services (RFHS) before transitioning to mainstream
general practice for ongoing care. However the system is under strain: many
RFHS are operating at capacity, transition to general practice is inconsistent,
and mainstream general practice has found it difficult to provide high quality
care to this vulnerable population. </p><p><b>Aims</b>: Our multi-sectoral
partnership aligns academics, clinicians and community members with 11
national, state and local organisations responsible for delivering community
based care to refugees. We will design and trial (evaluate?) a model of
integrated refugee primary health care suitable for uptake (adaptation)
throughout Australia. Subsidiary aims are to increase the accessibility of RFHSs,
optimise systems for transitioning refugee clients between services and to increase
the ability of mainstream general practices to deliver appropriate care to
refugees.</p><p><b>Methods</b>: The four-year
project is based on principles of participatory research and implementation
science. Three Regional Partnerships, comprising clinicians, policy makers,
academics and community members, will work together to identify gaps in the
current system of care for refugees, then work to improve service capacity,
client transition and quality of care for refugees living within each region. </p><p>





</p><p><b>Innovative contribution
to policy, practice and/or research:</b> Our partnership will generate robust,
regionally relevant and adaptable improvements to systems of care for refugees;
create a framework for adapting an intervention to local contexts to address
local health system priority gaps; generate knowledge on practical participatory
research strategies, and develop the primary health care systemâ€™s capacity to
facilitate ongoing improvement to the system of caring for refugees in the
community.</p><p><br></p><p><b>Citation</b></p><p>Gunatillaka N, Cheng I, Advocat J, Teede H,

types of experiments for example RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq, ATAC-Seq, Hi-C and 
single cell sequencing data coherently is a difficult task. Many 
existing data integration strategies involve repeatedly summarising 
layers of information, as raw sequence data from each of the different 
types of sequencing experiments is not directly comparable. This process
 usually collapses the information to sets of gene regulatory networks 
for direct comparison. As a result, a significant volume of quantitative
 information is lost.<br><br>Therefore, a data-driven approach was taken
 to address this problem, designed to take high throughput sequencing 
data directly as input. In the overall framework, known models of gene 
regulatory patterns such as position weight matrices will be 
incorporated. This will be supplemented with available biological 
information of the system such as evolutionary information in the form 
of phylogenetic distances, interaction maps of biomolecules (DNA, RNA or
 protein).<br><br>The end result is an agnostic framework which is 
capable of taking any combination of types of high throughput sequencing
 data, and identifying any regulatory patterns present within DNA 
sequences of interest. A major advantage of the design is that it limits
 significant assumptions about the data as the user will be required to 
input high throughput sequencing data directly, instead of summarised or
 heavily processed data. At the same time, providing data in its primary
 form reduces information loss, allowing the algorithm to be more 
sensitive to weak signals in the data.<br>",poster,['Bioinformatics and computational biology not elsewhere classified'],[],1,1,12,Comparison Records,708,2019-12-20T07:17:38,1

We can usually do this with high confidence. With comparable duration of presentation, we sometimes find it difficult to perceive some aspects of the artificial images (e.g., Gabor-patches and letters) typically used in laboratory settings. These and other evidence have resulted in opposing views on the accuracy of visual perception with its associated subjective confidence, which may or may not reflect the accuracy of perception. To examine these issues, we devised a novel online task, where 640 participants were tested with naturalistic (N=420) and artificial (N=8) images. Participants viewed each image briefly (67, 133 or 267ms) and described their impression with five English words together with confidence ratings (0-4). For naturalistic images, we found that 133ms and 267ms presentation time resulted in similarly detailed reports, with similar degrees of high confidence. At 67ms, participants reported basic-category words more often, with lower confidence than 133 and 267ms presentation times. For artificial images, descriptions often contained many non-veridical reports and low confidence. These results caution us on what we can conclude about how human conscious visual experience evolves over short time-scales from typical lab stimuli; each naturalistic image can give us distinguishable and unique impressions, implying massive differentiability, while artificial images are less distinguishable. We conclude that usage of naturalistic stimuli to probe broader aspects of a moment of conscious experience leads to higher estimates of consciously available and differentiable information.</p></div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>References</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div><div>Haun, A.

Specifically, based on the phenomenologial analysis, IIT gives two predictions about the relationships between consciousness and its informational structure. One is that quality of consciousness (e.g. seeing of face) correlates with ""shape"" of ""Integrated Information Strucutre (IIS)"" (so-called Maximally Integrated Conceptual Structure (Oizumi et al., 2014)). The other is that quantity of consciousness (e.g. awake vs sleep) correlates with ""system-level Integrated Information (system-level II)"" (so-called big-phi (Oizumi et al., 2014)). In addition, IIT prescribes methods to estimate both IIS and system-level II based on our knowledge of the neural system. Previously, we made a first step towards the empirical testing of an IIT's prediction on quality of consciousness by analysing human Electrocorticographic (ECoG) data obtained from visual perception experiments (Haun et al., 2017). Here, we resolved several issues in the study, specifically issues that are associated with the computation of IIS and system-level II. In our preliminary analysis with the improved method, we tested the two IIT predictions on the neural data recorded from one patient, finding that IIS correlated with visual preception while system-level II did not. We plan to replicate this result using data obtained from other subjects and other experiments.</p><p><br></p><p><b>References</b></p><p>Oizumi, M., Albantakis, L., & Tononi, G. (2014).

However, the mechanism that concentrates gold to extremely high â€œbonanzaâ€ grades within these deposits remains enigmatic. The volume of fluid experimentally required to provide such endowments of gold in a localised area is not reflected in field observations (e.g., in the extent of quartz veining or hydrothermal mineral alteration). To explain the genesis of bonanza-grade gold lodes in orogenic settings, a model termed â€œaseismic refinementâ€ has been developed through characterisation of ultra high-grade (upwards of ~3% Au) ore found in quartz veins at Fosterville gold mine (Victoria, Australia). Three distinct textural settings of visible gold have been distinguished and include (i) gold along stylolitic wallrock selvage pressure-solution seams (PSS); (ii) as a fine-grained â€œdusty gold seamsâ€ parallel and in the same orientation as PSS; and (iii) in tensile fractures which</div><div>are perpendicular to PSS. As visibile gold is most abundant when in conjunction with these features, it follows that pressure-dissolution may govern gold distribution and inter-seismic processes are likely to be signifcant during oregenesis. It is proposed that depressurization and fluid unmixing during seismic periods led to the deposition of abundant Au nanoparticles (Au NPs) in quartz-carbonate veins at Fosterville. Subsequent pressure-dissolution of quartz during interseismic intervals allowed for episodic removal of gangue material and the amalgamation of these Au nanoparticles around pressure-dissolution features. Repetition of this mechanism over the time scale of deposit formation acts to concentrate gold to anomalously high grades within the host vein. This mechanism provides a new insight for the genesis of ultra-rich gold mineralisation and,</div><div>based on textures reported from many gold deposits, may be an important step in the formation of orogenic gold deposits.</div>",poster,"['Geology not elsewhere classified', 'Exploration geochemistry']",[],2,0,7,Comparison Records,662,2018-07-26T06:44:59,1

<p>From included studies we collated key information including planned and actual sample size (number of participants and clusters), number of study arms, whether and how the sample size was justified, and whether an ICC was estimated. To explore differences across trial types we also collected data regarding cluster type, therapeutic area and type of funding.</p>
<p>The literature search produced 3168 records of which 178 studies met the inclusion criteria and were analysed.</p>
<p>Almost all studies (90%) had two arms, and none had more than four. Most studies were publicly funded (76%), and clusters were predominantly healthcare related (56%), constituting primary care (12%), secondary care (17%) ,social care (16%) and healthcare professionals (11%).</p>
<p>We found a median of 4 planned clusters per arm (IQR: 3,6; range: 2,150: ) and median planned participants of 75 per arm (IQR 40,200; range:20,3000 ).Studies randomising education clusters had the largest sample size median of 175 per arm, (IQR 75,305) and those randomising health professionals (median 44 per arm, IQR: 30,96) had the smallest.</p>
<p>Most studies did not justify their choice of sample size. Where this was reported, the most common justification was to estimate parameters for a main trial, in order for it to be adequately powered. The majority did not report an ICC estimate: a key parameter for designing a main cRCT.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The research suggests that 4 clusters per-arm is the most commonly reported sample size for pilot cRCTs but there was a very wide range. There is little consistency in the justification for the chosen sample size. While most pilot cRCTs are intended to provide estimates of key parameters for a main trial, few reported the ICC, an important parameter in cRCT design. Future work will explore whether and when 4 clusters per-arm is an appropriate sample size.</p>",poster,['Applied statistics'],[],1,0,5,Comparison Records,63,2022-10-03T12:18:16,1

<p><br></p>
<p>Â Â </p>
<p>Calculating the sample size for cluster-randomised controlled trials (cRCTs) requires an inflation factor to account for the intra-cluster correlation coefficient (ICC), a value that quantifies the degree of dependence within clusters. Estimates of the ICC are often taken from pilot or preliminary trials and are estimated with uncertainty. This uncertainty can have a marked impact on the resulting power of the trial being designed.Â </p>
<p>We aimed to develop an approach to account for the uncertainty in the ICC estimate when calculating the sample size for a cRCT with a continuous outcome.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>This was a methodological study using simulated data.Â </p>
<p>We developed an approach to account for the imprecision in the ICC estimate using numerical methods to integrate the sample size for a cRCT over plausible values of the ICC. This gives a sample size which is the average over all these plausible values.Â </p>
<p>We simulated 4 hypothetical scenarios which take an ICC estimate from pilot cRCTs of differing sizes. For each, we generated distributions of plausible values for the ICC estimated using Searleâ€™s, Swigerâ€™s and Fisherâ€™s methods. Finally, we calculated the sample size for a main cRCT using our integrative adjustment over the plausible ICC values provided by the three different methods. We compared these with two other common approaches.</p>
<p>A sensitivity analysis explored the impact of this approach on the main trial power in a realistic scenario.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In each case the main trial sample size using our integrative adjustment was greater than using the point estimate for the ICC which does not account for its imprecision. The overall sample size also depended on the number of clusters in the main trial. We found that this approach consistently preserved main trial power at 10% or more above using a simple ICC point estimate for realistic conservative scenarios.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The proposed method estimates the sample size for a cRCT that accounts for the imprecision in the ICC and thus can help mitigate potential power loss that can result from using an uncertain point ICC estimate. This method can be used with any means of estimating distributions of plausible values for the ICC, allowing broad applicability. Â This work has been published in Statistical Methods in Medical Research and R code for the calculation of the adjusted cRCT sample size is available.</p>",poster,['Applied statistics'],[],1,0,5,Comparison Records,67,2022-10-02T12:09:05,1

Despite the platformâ€™s importance, there is a scarcity of analyses on how Google determines the visibility of images within its search rankings. For example, is â€œauthorityâ€ determined in a similar way to its textual web search results? Or do computer vision techniques offer new criteria for promoting images and the websites that host them? Â </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>This research project focused on the visualisation of [climate change] and [biodiversity loss] by building a dataset of country-specific search rankings from Google Images. We scraped data from six different countries, selected for their political and geographic diversity in relation to the environment: Australia, Netherlands, Nigeria, China, Mexico and Brazil. We also built on findings from two previous DMI Summer School projects, <sub><a href=""https://wiki.digitalmethods.net/Dmi/MakingClimateVisible"" target=""_blank"">Making Climate Visible</a></sub> (2017) and <sub><a href=""https://wiki.digitalmethods.net/Dmi/ClimateImageSpaces"" target=""_blank"">Climate Image Spaces</a></sub> (2019), that suggested that Google Images shows a dehumanised visuality of climate change dominated by landscapes, charts and the Earth.Â </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Google Images has a homogenising effect on the visual representation of both climate change and biodiversity loss. For climate change, generic representations of climate change dominate. In particular, a small number of stock images enjoy repeated high rankings across the different countries. Many of these images have a half and half â€œleft/rightâ€ layout suggesting the current, often dystopian, situation on the left, with a more hopeful utopian future on the right (occasionally this implied temporality is reversed). Examples of these images include â€œhand in earthâ€, â€œlandscapeâ€ and â€œtreeâ€. Within the biodiversity loss images, there is also homogeneity, although with some greater country-specific diversity. Stock imagery is less dominant, but half and half images remain important. Although biodiversity loss covers many different aspects of environmental degradation, the imagery focuses almost exclusively on deforestation.Â </p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Images appear to be ranked on whether they â€œaccordâ€ with Googleâ€™s envisioning of climate change and biodiversity loss as time-less, place-less, human-less and cause-less. Websites whose images do not accord with these visions are unlikely to be ranked highly by Google Images.Â </strong></p>

<p>Submitted Abstract:</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong> Recorded telephone coaching sessions (approximately 24,500) in English and Spanish from 1205 women participating in the Lifestyle Intervention for oVarian cancer Enhanced Survival (LIvES), GOG 0225, study were used for this analysis. The LIvES Study tested whether a lifestyle intervention of increased physical activity and a healthy diet would increase progression-free survival compared to an attention control using trained health coaches and Motivational Interviewing (MI), a directive, patient-centered counseling approach; 323 LIvES Study coaching session recordings were scored for adherence to MI techniques. Here we describe lessons learned from a secondary analysis of LIvES data utilizing machine learning and natural language processing to automate fidelity and predict lifestyle behavioral outcomes.</p>
<p><strong>Methods:</strong> Numerous steps were necessary to prepare the call recordings for natural language processing. Data were aligned through a combination of participant phone numbers, coach names and participant names, entry dates and recording dates. Transcription was performed automatically with wav2vec. An annotation interface was developed using Label Studio and an annotation guideline was adapted from existing Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity (MITI) 3.0. Finally, a pilot annotation of the call recordings was completed and initial inter-rater reliability was measured.</p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong> The process of preparing this secondary analysis resulted in a number of lessons learned. First, data infrastructure for the original LIvES study, due to its long-running nature, evolved in ways that lost data continuity. The data alignment process would have been simplified by establishing a single identifier to link calls, outcomes, and MITI scores, and maintaining that identifier over the course of the project. Second, evaluating the quality of automated transcription systems is difficult and could have been streamlined by manually transcribing a small number of study calls to be used for evaluation. Finally, training a machine learning model to assess interviewer turns could have been simplified by establishing a protocol for coding MITI scoring using an annotation tool, resulting in turn-level annotations alongside the holistic scoring typical of MITI.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Behavioral interventions should engage the support of a computational scientist in the study design planning stage to take advantage of the largely under-utilized data collected in these trials.</p>

It is considered a particularly vulnerable area due to low adiposity, bone prominences, as well as the influence of vascular dysfunction in disease, and normal biological  aging of the local tissue (Delmore et al., 2015). There is only a small amount of tissue covering the posterior surface of the calcaneum which leads to particularly high interface pressures between the heel and the supporting surfaces (Mayrovitz, Macdonald and Smith, 1999) .The high interface pressure leads to damage of the microcirculation of the soft tissues overlaying the calcaneum, resulting in tissue ischaemia and necrosis (Ousey, 2009). 

Methods: In the present study, a custom skin deformation device, with an area of 33cm2, was used to locally apply a combination of pressures (6, 20, 60 and 100mmHg) and temperatures (33, 38Â°C) at the left posterior heel of eight healthy male volunteers (mean age, 24 Â± 2 years). A laser doppler flowmetry probe, embedded into the skin deformation device, was used to measure baseline skin blood flow, loaded skin blood flow (LSBF), and reactive hyperaemia (RH; quantified as aera under curve) on pressure release. Skin Blood Flow measures are all expressed as cutaneous vascular conductance (CVC = Flux/MAP). The relationship between local temperature (33-38Â°C) and pressure (6-100mmHg) application of LSBF and RH was then assessed via non-linear regression. (Burk and Grap, 2012)

Results: LSBF saw a significant reduction (p<0.003) as the applied pressure increased, falling from 2.1 Â± 0.1au at 6mmHg, to 0.8 Â± 0.01au at 20mmHg, to 0.2 Â± 0.13au at 60mmHg, and finally to 0.2 Â± 0.15au at 100mmHg. There were significant differences observed between all LSBF apart from the values for 60 and 100mmHg, which had a mean difference of only 0.01au. Temperature had a significant (p=0.015) effect on LSBF, which increased from 0.6 Â± 0.1au at 33Â°C to 1.0 Â± 0.17au at 38Â°C. RH, saw a significant (p=0.003) increase between the temperatures of 33 and 38Â°C, increasing from 9.0 Â± 5.9 to 17.9 Â± 12.9. Significant differences (p<0.001) were also observed between the bodyâ€™s hyperaemic response to the pressures of 20 to 60 and 100mmHg, increasing from 7.4 Â± 2.67 to 18.8 Â± 11.2au and 21.6 Â± 11.5au. RH data demonstrated a quadratic increase with increasing interface pressures at both 33Â°C and 38Â°C, plateauing at 90mmHg irrespective of temperature. When interpolated, LSBF demonstrated a quadratic decline with increasing pressure at 33Â°C, and a power decline with increasing pressure at 38Â°C, predicting LSBF to shut down completely at 45mmHg, and 55mmHg, respectively.

Conclusions: This study characterized the relationship between local temperature (33-38Â°C) and pressure application (6-100mmHg) on LSBF and RH.

Chand (2001) has identified that local NGOs which are working and advocating in the sector like drinking water and sanitation requires robust organizational technical and management capacity. Due to the lack of capacity of local NGOs, INGOs and donors preferably work with other INGOs or civic groups formed by donors and communities (ADB, 2005). This situation leads to a vicious cycle where a local NGO having low organizational capacity is left behind without having an opportunity to partner with INGOs. This ultimately leads to limiting the prospects of having access to learning and sharing opportunities for their overall organizational growth and development.

Prolonged cell deformation is known to reduce the structural integrity of the cell cytoskeleton, leading to cascade of cell death, inflammation, oedema and oxidative stress, factors that are like exacerbated by inadequate blood flow and oxygen delivery. Numerous secondary factors are thought to accelerate this cascade, including systemic hypoxia and changes in tissue temperature. By examining the responses of various skin viability markers, both during and after the application of temperature and pressure stimuli, the present study aims to expand understanding of the secondary factors affecting pressure ulcers onset and progression. In the present study, a custom skin deformation device, with an area of 33cm2, was used to apply a combination of pressures (6, 20 and 40mmHg) and temperatures (33, 33, 38Â°C) at the sacrum of four healthy volunteers (data collection ongoing). A laser doppler flowmetry probe, embedded into the skin deformation device, was used to measure baseline skin blood flow, skin blood flow under pressure, and reactive hyperaemia (RH) on pressure release. All measurements were calculated as a percentage of heat-induced maximal cutaneous vascular conductance (%CVCmax). Changes in stratum corneum and epidermal hydration were calculated using the difference in tissue electrical capacitance (corneometry) measurements before and after skin deformation. The results indicated a significant difference in loaded skin blood flow between the pressures of 6-20mmHg (p=0.045), and 6-40mmHg (p=0.018), decreasing from 30.5 Â± 9.1 %CVCmax to 21.8 Â± 9.0 %CVCmax and 17.5 Â± 6.7 %CVCmax respectively. Furthermore, there was a significant increase (p=0.030) from 16.9 Â± 8.2 %CVCmax to 29.8 Â± 5.4 %CVCmax in loaded skin blood flow, between the temperatures of 28-38Â°C. Finally, blood flow saw a significant (p=0.005) increase on pressure release, from a loaded average of 19.7 Â± 8.2 %CVCmax to an unloaded average of 29.0 Â± 12.0 %CVCmax, however there was no significant effect of pressure level or temperature on reactive hyperemia. Changes in stratum corneum hydration between 28-33Â°C (p=0.044), and 28-38Â°C (p=0.019), increased from 20.8 Â± 11.3% to 38.8 Â± 12.7% and 48.5 Â± 15.5% respectively. Differing pressures and temperatures had no significant effect on epidermal hydration. Initial indications from the present study suggest low local tissue temperature reduces tissue blood flow under pressure, thereby potentially reducing oxygen transport to, and metabolites away from, areas of loaded tissue. However, increased local temperature results in greater moisture accumulation on the surface layer of the cutaneous tissues, potentially resulting in a lower structural integrity, and when combined with a higher metabolism, may result in a faster rate of tissue breakdown. On balance, a neutral skin temperature may be best skin to balance the harmful effects pressure on tissue viability, but further investigation is required to fully understand the influence of temperature on each aspect of the pressure injury cascade, including cell cytoskeleton integrity, inflammation, and oedema, as well as blood flow dynamics, oxygen delivery, cell metabolism and oxidative stress.",poster,[],[],0,0,4,Comparison Records,128,2021-06-28T14:25:47,1

Title: Assessing pharmacy student driven refill capture and adherence improvement in a health systems pharmacy setting</div><div><br></div><div>Primary Author: Bradley Hughes, PharmD; University of Illinois at Chicago
Email: brhughes@uic.edu</div><div><br></div><div>Additional Authors: Alexander Infante, PharmD Candidate
Monazzah Sarwar, PharmD<div><br></div><div>Purpose: In order to improve medication adherence, combat DIR fees and improve refill capture in a pharmacy health system with limited financial resources we implemented a program using students to manage refill requests. UIHealth pharmacies use Enterprise software which is equipped with a Contact Manager for organizing refills requests and replies, but due to the temporary staffing nature of our resident prescribers many refill requests are either not generated automatically within Enterprise or are simply ignored. By offering elective credit to students our goal was to allow an opportunity for professional development while providing better and timelier patient care.</div><div><br></div><div>Method: Our Contact Manger refill pilot program consisted of three phases. Phase 1 began during the summer of 2018 and involved the centralized facilitation on an informal basis of refill management with no record keeping or data analysis. Phase 2 involved the expansion of the program to include three pharmacy students from the University of Illinois College of Pharmacy. The students were trained on our pharmacy and hospital software and then given access to their respective pharmacies. Weekly logs were maintained to quantify progress in the program. Phase 3 involved the further expansion of the program to four students, this time without the training requirement since student externs were recruited, and the same records were kept for further evaluation of the program.</div><div><br></div><div>Results: Pharmacy students worked in weekly two hour increments and an overall measurement was taken of events worked on in the contact manager. Data was recorded using a spreadsheet; attempts were identified as either an initial attempt, the deletion of a duplicate entry or an event that was already completed, and a received reply (either refill approval, denial or dose modification). A weekly evaluation was made to determine students were improving on a regular basis. Upon conclusion of the pilot students were performing over 100 contact manager events every week which is outreach that was taking days, sometimes weeks to occur using our existing staffing model. Although adherence data is still being analyzed feedback from pharmacy staff as well as the students who participated was positive, and raw data clearly shows an improvement in refill capture as well as the elimination of contact manager events which have already been responded to and prohibit the efficient sorting of the queue.</div><div><br></div><div>Conclusion: Health systems pharmacies with limited staffing resources and time that have access to an associated college of pharmacy can greatly benefit by incorporating students into the workflow. This also offers an opportunity for the students to get valuable work experience. In our health systems setting by offering elective credit we were able to successfully engage students in helping us to manage our refill capture and improve patient adherence.</div></div>",poster,['Uncategorized'],[],1,0,1,Comparison Records,110,2021-09-27T14:51:33,1

Trading takes place asynchronously through a matching engine in event time. The optimal execution agent is considered at different levels of initial order-sizes and differently sized state spaces. The resulting impact on the agent-based model and market are considered using a calibration approach that explores changes in the empirical stylised facts and price impact curves. Convergence, volume trajectory and action trace plots are used to visualise the learning dynamics.Â </p>
<p>Please follow the README.md on the GitHub page for instructions on how to run the code. For example, the Calibrated-ABM branch contains the functionality to perform the simulation, sensitivity analysis, and calibration of the event-time ABM, while the RL-ABM branch extends the Calibrated-ABM branch and allows you to train an RL agent inside an event-based ABM.</p>

The procedure is focussed on known shortcomings of South African rainfall data. <br><br>The novel component of the procedure is its use of Generalised Additive Models for Location, Scale and Shape (GAMLSS) both for infilling of daily values and for assessing the probability of observing values as extreme as suspect recorded values or sequences of values. Models are fit for the probability of rainfall occurrence and the mean and variance of daily totals, as parameters of a Zero-Inflated Gamma distribution. Other GAMLSS-compatible distributions could relatively easily be used instead. The infilling is quasi-stochastic: rainfall occurrence is modelled as a binomial random variable, mean estimates of rainfall amount are used directly if a day is selected as a rain day. <br><br><div>Details of the functions used and the inputs of each major</div><div>component of the procedure are set out in the files provided. <br></div><div>Comments preceded by 3 hashes (`###`) at the top of a function contains such descriptions. <br></div><br>A forthcoming paper will describe the procedure in full detail and demonstrate its effectiveness on a test dataset.

well-established test used for the characterisation of sheet metals. The
 specimen is intended to deform in planar simple shear and is designed 
to be machined with a continuous annular shear zone. As a result, there 
are no â€œedge effectsâ€ or geometric discontinuities to generate 
instabilities, thus large true strains up to 1 can be achieved. Before 
this research, the specimen had only been used for material 
characterisation in the quasi-static regime. The aim of this research 
was to conduct further quasi-static testing using the in-plane torsion 
test and to extend its use into the dynamic regime. Quasi-static tests 
were performed on a quasi-static torsional (QST) system that was 
designed to be integrated onto a Zwick universal testing machine. 
Dynamic tests were performed on a modified torsional split Hopkinson bar (TSHB)
 system. The TSHB system adopted a nested configuration which allowed 
for a longer incident bar, and thus larger obtainable strains. Two 
quick-release mechanisms were used, one using a novel reusable wedge and
 the other using fracture-pins. All specimens were manufactured from Al 
1050 H14. Typical results agreed with material test data available in 
the literature. Both systems attained large strains at near-constant 
strain rates and together, allowed for material characterisation over a 
large range of strain rates. Near-uniform deformations were observed for
 specimens with lower strain gauge widths. An added feature of the 
specimen was the flat reverse face, which together with the nested 
configuration of both systems allows for the possibility for full-field 
DIC measurement in the future. An estimation method for steady-state 
flow stress is presented with the steady-state flow stress found to be 
rate dependant. Finally, a relationship between the steady-state flow 
stress and strain rate for all experimental results is proposed.</div></div>",software,['Mechanical engineering not elsewhere classified'],"[{'item_id': 16866403, 'grant_title': 'Privately', 'funder_name': None, 'postDate': '2022-01-21T13:19:18'}]",1,0,7,Comparison Records,99,2022-01-21T13:19:18,1

The model is used for understanding daily trading decisions made from closing auction to closing auction in equity markets, as it attempts to model financial market behaviour without the inclusion of agent adaptation. However, our attempt at calibrating the model has limited success in replicating important stylized facts observed in financial markets, similar to what has been found in other calibration experiments of the model. This leads us to extend the Farmer-Joshi model to include agent adaptation using a Brock-Hommes (1998) approach to strategy fitness based on trading strategy proï¬tability. The adaptive Farmer-Joshi model allows trading agents to switch between strategies, favouring strategies that have been more profitable over some period of time determined by a free-parameter determining the profit monitoring time-horizon.",software,['Statistics not elsewhere classified'],[],1,1,7,Comparison Records,734,2020-01-20T13:33:51,1

There are over 1,000 transcription factors (TFs) in vertebrates that play a role in this regulation. Determining which of these are likely to be controlling a set of genes can be assisted by computational prediction, utilising experimentally verified binding site motifs. Here we present CiiiDER, an integrated computational toolkit for transcription factor binding analysis, written in the Java programming language, to make it independent of computer operating system. It is operated through an intuitive graphical user interface with interactive, high-quality visual outputs, making it accessible to all researchers. CiiiDER predicts transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) across regulatory regions of interest, such as promoters and enhancers derived from any species. It can perform an enrichment analysis to identify TFs that are significantly over- or under-represented in comparison to a bespoke background set and thereby elucidate pathways regulating sets of genes of pathophysiological importance.</p>",software,"['Bioinformatics and computational biology not elsewhere classified', 'Sequence analysis', 'Genomics and transcriptomics']","[{'item_id': 20353410, 'grant_title': 'Australian National Health and Medical Research Council', 'funder_name': None, 'postDate': '2022-08-02T01:04:42'}]",3,3,4,Comparison Records,145,2022-08-02T01:04:42,1

One solution to this problem is to split ventilators between multiple patients, which poses the difficulty of treating two patients with dissimilar ventilation needs. A proposed solution to this problem is the use of 3D-printed flow splitters and restrictors. There is little data available on the reliability of such devices and how the use of different 3D printing methods might affect their performance. </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We performed flow resistance measurements on 30 different 3D-printed restrictor designs produced using a range of fused deposition modelling and stereolithography printers and materials, from consumer grade printers using polylactic acid filament to professional printers using surgical resin. We compared their performance to novel computational fluid dynamics models driven by empirical ventilator flow rate data. This indicates the ideal performance of a part that matches the computer model.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The 3D-printed restrictors varied considerably between printers and materials to a sufficient degree that would make them unsafe for clinical use without individual testing. This occurs because the interior surface of the restrictor is rough and has a reduced nominal average diameter when compared to the computer model. However, we have also shown that with careful calibration it is possible to tune the end-inspiratory (tidal) volume by titrating the inspiratory time on the ventilator.</p>

Â </li>
  <li><strong>Configuration</strong>: morphologica allows you to easily set up a simulation parameter configuration system, using the JSON reading and writing abilities of <a href=""https://github.com/ABRG-Models/morphologica/blob/main/morph/Config.h"" target=""_blank""><strong>morph::Config</strong></a>.

  <li><strong>Saving data from your simulation</strong>. morphologica provides a set of easy-to-use convenience wrappers (<a href=""https://github.com/ABRG-Models/morphologica/blob/main/morph/HdfData.h"" target=""_blank""><strong>morph::HdfData</strong></a>) around the HDF5 C API.

scripts provided can be used to automatically map surface meltwater in
Antarctica from Landsat optical satellite images. The main lake mapping script
is run in Google Earth Engine (GEE), and requires three inputs: 1) A start and
end date for the mapping period; 2) A shapefile to specify the total area over
which lakes will be mapped; 3) The temporal resolution at which results will be
generated (e.g. given number of days/months). Results are exported from GEE as
a GEOJSON file. The post-processing script is run in Matlab, and performs
post-processing steps on the GEOJSON file. This script creates shapefile lake
outputs for each time step. For further information, please see the README
file, the companion paper (Tuckett et al., 2021), or contact Peter Tuckett

Here, we examined how bees solve a numeric-based task utilizing stimuli common amongst numerical cognition studies. Bees performed well on the task, but additional tests showed that they had learned continuous (non-numerical) cues. In simulations a simple network model containing just nine elements was capable of learning the task, but did so using continuous cues inherent in the training stimuli, with no numerical processing. This model was able to reproduce behaviours that have been considered in other studies indicative of numerical cognition. Our results support the idea that a sense of magnitude may be more primitive and basic than any sense of number. Our findings highlight how problematic inadvertent continuous cues can be for animal studies of numerical cognition. This remains a deep issue within the field of numerical cognition that requires increased vigilance and cleverness on our (the experimenterâ€™s) part. We discuss what we view as currently the best methods for, and suggest new ways by which we can improve assessing, numerical cognition in non-speaking animals.<br></p>",software,"['Animal behaviour', 'Behavioural neuroscience', 'Bioinformatics and computational biology not elsewhere classified', 'Neurosciences not elsewhere classified']","[{'item_id': 12101403, 'grant_title': 'Brains on Board: Neuromorphic Control of Flying Robots', 'funder_name': 'Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council', 'postDate': '2021-08-08T22:58:53'}]",4,1,11,Comparison Records,1078,2020-04-09T22:10:14,3

<p>Improving the basis for earthquake hazard assessemt relies in part on structural observation of natural fault zones, on laboratory experiments, and on theoretical developments. While quantitative models that reproduce the laboratory data on frictional slip on faults is the minimum necessary to simulate their mechanical behavior in nature, convincing models must ultimately also account for all key fault zone observations. Taking a fault in carbonate rock as an example, and using fundamental data on the microscale processes that lead to fault friction, this work takes a first step towards simulating the dynamic evolution and self-organization of internal fault zone (micro)structure, processes and properties during a seismic slip event. The results show that the model captures many key observations on seismic fault behaviour, paving the way for still further improvements in developing a physics-based understanding of earthquake rupture in future. The present dataset includes the raw codes of four cases that are implemented in the finite element model (FEM) package Comsol (version 3.5a), and the numerical data produced by the codes (Results I to IV).

A powerful approach is to use multi-qubit network nodes which provide the quantum memory and computational power to perform entanglement distillation, quantum error correction,</div><div>and information processing. Nuclear spins associated with optically-active defects in diamond are promising qubits for this role. However, their dephasing during entanglement distribution across the optical network hinders scaling to larger systems. In this work, we show that a single 13C spin in isotopically engineered diamond offers a long-lived quantum memory that is robust to the optical link operation. The memory lifetime is improved by two orders-of-magnitude over the longest reported value, and exceeds the best reported times for making photonic entanglement. We identify ionisation of the NV center as a newly limiting decoherence mechanism. As a first step towards overcoming this limitation, we demonstrate that the nuclear spin state can be retrieved with high fidelity after a complete cycle of ionisation and recapture. Finally, we use numerical simulations to show that the combination of this improved memory lifetime with previously demonstrated entanglement links and gate operations can enable key primitives for quantum networks, such as deterministic nonlocal two-qubit logic operations and GHZ state creation across four network nodes. Our results pave the way for test-bed quantum networks capable of investigating complex algorithms and error correction.</div>",software,"['Other Information and Computing Sciences', 'Numerical and Computational Mathematics']","[{'item_id': 16887658, 'grant_title': 'The Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO/OCW), Vidi grant and as part of the Frontiers of Nanoscience (NanoFront) program', 'funder_name': None, 'postDate': '2022-07-05T14:07:06'}, {'item_id': 16887658, 'grant_title': ""The European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (grant agreement No. 852410)"", 'funder_name': None, 'postDate': '2022-07-05T14:07:06'}, {'item_id': 16887658, 'grant_title': ""Netherlands Enterprise Agency (project number PPS2007) and European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program (grant agreement No. 820445)"", 'funder_name': None, 'postDate': '2022-07-05T14:07:06'}, {'item_id': 16887658, 'grant_title': 'Erwin-SchrÃ¶dinger fellowship (QuantNet, No. J 4229-N27) of the Austrian National Science Foundation (FWF)', 'funder_name': None, 'postDate': '2022-07-05T14:07:06'}, {'item_id': 16887658, 'grant_title': 'The Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO/OCW), as part of the Quantum Software Consortium Program under Project 024.003.037/3368', 'funder_name': None, 'postDate': '2022-07-05T14:07:06'}, {'item_id': 16887658, 'grant_title': 'Joint research program ""Modular quantum computers"" by Fujitsu Limited and Delft University of Technology', 'funder_name': None, 'postDate': '2022-07-05T14:07:06'}]",2,0,2,Comparison Records,565,2021-11-04T15:03:12,3

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF) is<br>
an imaging technique for simultaneous estimation of multiple quantitative parameters in a single acquisition. The efficiency of MRF results from strong k-space undersampling, but this can go at the expense of strong aliasing artifacts. The errors due to undersampling can be predicted based on a mathematical model leveraging on perturbation<br>
theory. We exploited this model to perform MRF sequence optimization by adjusting the MRF flip angle train. Numerical simulations showed that the undersampling errors can be suppressed by sequence optimization. This was further corroborated in eight in vivo scans. The results were compared to sequences with a conventionally shaped flip angle pattern and an optimized pattern based on the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRB). A sequence optimized for improved<br>
robustness against undersampling with a flip angle train of length 400 yielded significantly lower median absolute errors T1 (5.6%Â±2.9%) and T2 (7.9%Â±2.3%) compared to the conventional (T1: 8.0% Â± 1.9%, T2: 14.5% Â± 2.6%) and CRB-based (T1: 21.6% Â± 4.1%, T2: 31.4% Â± 4.4%) sequences. The proposed optimization scheme can be adapted to different<br>
scan settings, reference maps and optimization parameters in a straightforward manner.Â </p>",software,"['Biomedical Engineering', 'Clinical Sciences']","[{'item_id': 20101127, 'grant_title': 'Medical Delta Dementia and Stroke 2.0', 'funder_name': None, 'postDate': '2022-06-21T07:04:48'}]",2,1,4,Comparison Records,112,2022-06-20T13:05:36,2

Authors of STOKE make some extraordinary claims. They suggest that it is able to produce programs that are multiple times faster than programs without any optimization, and programs which are at least as efficient as programs produced by gcc -O3 and sometimes expert handwritten assembly. The goal of this paper is to check these claims. In this paper classes of programs that STOKE may handle particularly well and any class of programs that stochastic optimization might not be able to handle will be identified. We conclude from the experiments described in this paper that STOKE is able to fulfill that statement in some cases. The searching algorithm of STOKE is not always able to find programs that are at least as efficient as programs optimized by gcc -O3. STOKE works particularly well in programs where a lot consecutive logical and mathematical operations are calculating (e.g. counting bits). It is often not that successful with programs containing loops where it sometimes canâ€™t find a solution at all.</p>",software,['Computer Software'],[],1,0,3,Comparison Records,121,2022-06-20T15:50:11,1

However, most studies of intermittent streams are conducted at extremes of scale, are limited in taxonomic and temporal scope, and focus exclusively on drying patterns. Here, we assessed how both flow intermittency and orientation to perennial refuges affect aquatic invertebrates and aquatic and semi-aquatic vertebrates across two years within two intermittent river basins differing in their aridity. We used loggers to characterize flow intermittency and wet-dry mapping to determine orientation to perennial refuge of reaches. In winter and summer 2015 and 2016, we collected and identified invertebrates and visually surveyed vertebrates. Using permutational multivariate analyses of variance with distance matrices, we found distinct invertebrate communities by basin, flow class (perennial or intermittent), and season, and distinct vertebrate communities by basin, and between flow classes and seasons in the more arid basin. Invertebrate communities had higher beta diversity in the more arid than mesic basin, whereas the opposite was true for vertebrates. We identified indicator species for all combinations of basin and flow class, perennial reaches combined from both basins, each basin, and some combinations of flow class and season within basins. Flow intermittency and orientation to perennial refuge predictors correlated well with both invertebrate and vertebrate communities. However, we did not find nestedness of communities that differed significantly from that expected by chance in response to increasing flow intermittency or distance to refuge. Lastly, basin, flow intermittency, and orientation to perennial refuge predictors were generally important for modeling taxon richness and densities, and richness and densities decreased with increasing flow intermittency and distance to perennial refuge. Collectively, our data suggest that intermittent streams harbor unique biodiversity, but also that some taxa have context-dependent responses to intermittency and orientation to perennial refuges. These findings also suggest that future increases in stream drying are likely to lead to changes to stream communities with high potential for the loss of aquatic biodiversity.<br></div><div><p></p><div><div><br></div><div><hr></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><i>For inquiries regarding the contents of this dataset, please contact the Corresponding Author listed in the README.txt file.

Shape (the relative lengths of three orthogonal axes) is a key property of sedimentary particles, providing information on provenance, transport history and depositional environment. However, the usefulness of shape data, including the ability to make robust comparisons between samples, has been constrained by the absence of a satisfactory definition of the mean shape for a sample of particles. Such a definition is proposed and used to develop confidence regions for the population mean shape using both parametric (theoretical) and computational (bootstrap) methods. These techniques are based on a transform that permits multivariate statistical methods for the analysis of compositional data to be extended to shape. These techniques are validated with reference to a dataset of 169 clast samples and found to perform well. A statistical test on the mean â€“ using the multivariate extension of Student's <i>t</i>â€test, Hotelling's <i>T</i><sup>2</sup> â€“ is presented. The benefits of the methods presented are demonstrated with reference to a case study.</div>",software,"['Geology not elsewhere classified', 'Physical geography and environmental geoscience not elsewhere classified', 'Quaternary environments', 'Sedimentology', 'Geomorphology and earth surface processes']",[],5,2,10,Comparison Records,617,2019-08-23T08:04:49,1

The purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare the upper limb kinematics and handbike configurations of recreational and competitive recumbent handcyclists, during sportâ€specific intensities. Thirteen handcyclists were divided into two significantly different groups based on peak aerobic power output (POpeak) and race experience; competitive (n = 7; 5 H3 and 2 H4 classes; POpeak: 247 Â± 20 W) and recreational (n = 6; 4 H3 and 2 H4 classes; POpeak: 198 Â± 21 W). Participants performed bouts of exercise at training (50% POpeak), competition (70% POpeak), and sprint intensity while threeâ€dimensional kinematic data (thorax, scapula, shoulder, elbow, and wrist) were collected. Statistical parametric mapping was used to compare the kinematics of competitive and recreational handcyclists. Handbike configurations were determined from additional markers on the handbike. Competitive handcyclists flexed their thorax (~5Â°, <i>P</i> < 0.05), extended their shoulder (~10Â°, <i>P</i> < 0.01), and posteriorly tilted their scapular (~15Â°, <i>P</i> < 0.05) more than recreational handcyclists. Differences in scapular motion occurred only at training intensity while differences in shoulder extension and thorax flexion occurred both at training and competition intensities. No differences were observed during sprinting. No significant differences in handbike configuration were identified. This study is the first to compare the upper limb kinematics of competitive recreational handcyclists at sportâ€specific intensities. Competitive handcyclists employed significantly different propulsion strategies at training and competition intensities. Since no differences in handbike configuration were identified, these kinematic differences could be due to technical training adaptations potentially optimizing muscle recruitment or force generation of the arm.<br></div>",software,['Clinical microbiology'],"[{'item_id': 7718867, 'grant_title': 'Industrial CASE Account - Loughborough University 2014', 'funder_name': 'Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council', 'postDate': '2019-04-16T10:09:56'}]",1,2,2,Comparison Records,392,2019-04-16T10:09:56,1

The latest version of the model can be found here https://dspace.lboro.ac.uk/2134/15726. The four states of occupancy are described in terms of a ""combined state"" variable consisting of a first binary variable describing the occupancy state (1 = â€œat homeâ€, 0 = â€œnot at homeâ€) and a second binary variable describing the activity state (1 = â€œactiveâ€, 0 = â€œnot activeâ€).
