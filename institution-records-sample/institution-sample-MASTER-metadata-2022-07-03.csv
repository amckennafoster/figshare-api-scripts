Although frequently asymptomatic, <i>C. trachomatis</i> infections in women cause genital inflammation. Given that genital inflammation increases women’s risk for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, treating and preventing chlamydia is vital. Thus, the development of a vaccine is paramount in controlling infection and spread.  Research into new drugs should also be pursued, especially with the rise of antimicrobial resistance. Although <i>C. trachomatis</i> microbiology has advanced with technology, the culture and detection of <i>C. trachomatis in vitro</i> remains challenging. The aim of this study was to establish a method to quantify laboratory adapted stocks of <i>C. trachomatis</i> in <i>in vitro</i> cell culture.</p><p>First, <i>C. trachomatis</i> serovars E, H, L1 and L2 were propagated in McCoy cells, using centrifugation using an established protocol. These stocks of unknown concentration were used to compare and optimise quantification methods using fluorescent microscopy. Three commercially available reagents were compared: (1) Pathfinder’s <i>C. trachomatis </i>monoclonal antibody, (2) Invitrogen’s <i>C. trachomatis </i>MOMP antibodies, and (3) Trinity Biotech MicroTrak <i>C. trachomatis </i>culture confirmation kit.</p><p>The Pathfinder <i>C. trachomatis </i>monoclonal antibody kit and Invitrogen’s <i>C. trachomatis</i> MOMP Monoclonal Antibody kits both had poor sensitivity and gave high background fluorescent signals. Invitrogen’s polyclonal antibody yielded inconsistent results, being either very weakly fluorescent or giving extremely bright signals. Thus, enumeration using this polyclonal antibody had limited success and results were not reproducible. MicroTrak’s kit, in contrast, allowed for clear visualisation of inclusions and allowed for consistent and successful enumeration, although the  manufacturer has since taken the kit off the market.</p><p>In the research setting, fluorescent microscopy techniques are widely used for quantification of <i>C. trachomatis</i> due to their high sensitivity and inclusion bodies are easy to distinguish, even with an untrained eye. However, this study showed inconsistent and/or unreliable results from the available kits evaluated.  Although, rarely used in a research setting, future studies could explore qPCR-based methods to quantify <i>C. trachomatis</i> <i>in vitro.</i></p><p> </p><p> </p>",False,"[{'id': 21352057, 'title': 'MSC', 'grant_code': '', 'funder_name': None, 'is_user_defined': 1}]",False,0,0,0,5

Before this research, the specimen had only been used for material characterisation in the quasi-static regime. The aim of this research was to conduct further quasi-static testing using the in-plane torsion test and to extend its use into the dynamic regime. Quasi-static tests were performed on a quasi-static torsional (QST) system that was designed to be integrated onto a Zwick universal testing machine. Dynamic tests were performed on a modified torsional split Hopkinson bar (TSHB) system. The TSHB system adopted a nested configuration which allowed for a longer incident bar, and thus larger obtainable strains. Two quick-release mechanisms were used, one using a novel reusable wedge and the other using fracture-pins. All specimens were manufactured from Al 1050 H14. Typical results agreed with material test data available in the literature. Both systems attained large strains at near-constant strain rates and together, allowed for material characterisation over a large range of strain rates. Near-uniform deformations were observed for specimens with lower strain gauge widths. An added feature of the specimen was the flat reverse face, which together with the nested configuration of both systems allows for the possibility for full-field DIC measurement in the future. An estimation method for steady-state flow stress is presented with the steady-state flow stress found to be rate dependant. Finally, a relationship between the steady-state flow stress and strain rate for all experimental results is proposed.</div>",False,[],False,0,0,0,7

Weight gain and sub-optimal dietary choices are common in young adults, and social media may be a potential tool to facilitate and support healthier choices.</div><div><br></div><div><i>Methods</i></div><div>We conducted a mixed-methods systematic review of studies examining social media use for nutrition-related outcomes in young adults. Seven databases [EBscohost, ERIC, ProQuest Central, PubMed, Ovid, Scopus, and Emerald] were systematically searched; 1225 abstracts were screened, and 47 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility. Study designs included both quantitative, such as experimental and observational studies, and qualitative, such as focus groups and interviews, approaches. Quality was assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. Quantitative and qualitative results were examined separately, and then synthesized.</div><div><br></div><div><i>Results</i></div><div>Twenty-one studies were included although their use of social media was highly variable. The main purpose of social media was to provide information and social support to participants. In the nine randomized controlled trials, social media was used as one aspect of a multi-faceted intervention. Interventions had a positive statistically significant impact on nutritional outcomes in 1/9 trials. Engagement with the social media component of interventions varied, from 3 to 69%. Young adults appear to be open to receiving healthy eating and recipe tips through social media, however, they are reluctant to share personal weight-related information on their online social networks.</div><div><br></div><div><i>Conclusions</i></div><div>Information-dissemination is now an acceptable use of social media by young adults. Using social media effectively for social support, either via private groups or public pages, requires careful evaluation as its effectiveness is yet to be demonstrated in experimental designs. Concerns about public social media use may be a contributing factor to poor engagement with social media in research intervention studies aimed at influencing weight. Future research should consider how to best engage with young adults using social media, how to more effectively use social media to support young adults and to facilitate social and peer-to-peer support in making healthier choices</div></div>",False,"[{'id': 14185986, 'title': 'Communicating health: optimising engagement and retention using social media', 'grant_code': '1115496', 'funder_name': 'National Health and Medical Research Council', 'is_user_defined': 0, 'url': 'https://app.dimensions.ai/details/grant/grant.7878594'}]",False,0,4,2,14

being digitally savvy, the stress of study, influence of social media, climate
change and the impact of poor mental health. These perspectives, along with our
video series produced alongside this, allow us to see the complex situations
that impact the youth experience of education.</p>

<p>For
schools, teachers, parents and policy-makers it highlights the importance of
listening and collaboration with young people, particularly when developing
policies and implementing practice to build more inclusive communities. For
researchers, we hope this exhibition highlights one way to use participatory

<p>Flow patterns and particle accumulation were visualised by tracking the motion of suspended particles through the model. As per the cell migration studies, the protocol detailed in this section was carried out for a variety of coronary and flow diverter stents, as well as empty non-stented vessels as controls. However, 1.5 mm diameter models were not included in this study.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>2.3.1 Set up</p>
<p>Vessels were connected to a fluid reservoir and peristaltic pump, as described in Section 2.2.5.1. Any models previously used with HUVEC were first cleaned of debris. Reservoirs were filled with 12 ml of room temperature 70% industrial methylated spirit (IMS). A suspension of 10 µm polystyrene particles (FluoSpheres, Fisher Scientific) with 3.6 x 106 particles/ml was agitated via vortex mixer (Lab Dancer S42, IKA). 40 µl of the suspension was then transferred to the reservoir at a 250:1 fluid to particle volume ratio. The pump was briefly set to maximum power, to circulate the fluid and distribute the particles around the system. The flow rate was then reduced to 6.5 ml/min for 2 mm diameter vessels, and 12.8 ml/min for 2.5 mm diameter vessels. At these rates, the Reynolds number was 43 and 68 respectively, matching that in blood flow of 1 Pa wall shear stress within the same model.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>2.3.2 Image acquisition</p>
<p>Model vessels were placed onto the stage of an inverted microscope (AE2000, Motic), with a connected camera (Moticam 2300, Motic). A 4x objective lens was used to ensure the full diameter of the vessel was in view and a live image was displayed via Images Plus software (Motic). The vessel was oriented so that the leading edge of the stent was within the image, with flow moving horizontally from left to right. The bottommost stent struts were brought into focus, before light intensity, aperture diaphragm opening and camera exposure were adjusted until moving particles could be seen.</p>
<p>The camera software was used to record a 2 minute video. The vessel was then repositioned so that the field of view was moved downstream, with a small amount of overlap with the previous field. Another 2 minute video was recorded and the vessel repositioned again. This process was repeated until the downstream end of the stent was captured in a final field of view.</p>
<p>Once the procedure was complete, particle accumulation was recorded (see Section 2.3.5). Following this, the model was flushed, removed from the system and rinsed with acetone to dissolve and remove any remaining particles. The model was rotated by 90° to expose different stent geometry and reconnected to the pump with a fresh reservoir. The above process was then repeated.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>2.3.3 Image processing</p>
<p>Video recordings were split into image sequences using Video to JPG Converter software (DVDVideoSoft). These images were, if required, reoriented to ensure that the direction of flow was exactly horizontal and that adjacent fields of view could be aligned. The software returned images at a frame rate of 20 frames per second (fps), and every second frame was selected. For each field of view two sets of 300 images, each representing roughly 30 seconds of flow, were selected for tracking. </p>
<p>One frame from each image sequence was used to isolate the struts by removing the PDMS wall, along with any attached particles or debris, providing a clear image of stent geometry onto which tracks could be overlaid.</p>",False,"[{'id': 27380, 'title': 'EPSRC', 'grant_code': '', 'funder_name': None, 'is_user_defined': 1}, {'id': 27692, 'title': 'Wellcome Trust', 'grant_code': '', 'funder_name': None, 'is_user_defined': 1}, {'id': 52814, 'title': 'British Heart Foundation', 'grant_code': '', 'funder_name': None, 'is_user_defined': 1}]",False,0,1,0,1

<p>Vessels were connected to a fluid reservoir and peristaltic pump, as described in Section 2.2.5.1. Any models previously used with HUVEC were first cleaned of debris. Reservoirs were filled with 12 ml of room temperature 70% industrial methylated spirit (IMS). A suspension of 10 µm polystyrene particles (FluoSpheres, Fisher Scientific) with 3.6 x 106 particles/ml was agitated via vortex mixer (Lab Dancer S42, IKA). 40 µl of the suspension was then transferred to the reservoir at a 250:1 fluid to particle volume ratio. The pump was briefly set to maximum power, to circulate the fluid and distribute the particles around the system. The flow rate was then reduced to 6.5 ml/min for 2 mm diameter vessels, and 12.8 ml/min for 2.5 mm diameter vessels. At these rates, the Reynolds number was 43 and 68 respectively, matching that in blood flow of 1 Pa wall shear stress within the same model.</p>

The flow rate was then reduced to 6.5 ml/min for 2 mm diameter vessels, and 12.8 ml/min for 2.5 mm diameter vessels. At these rates, the Reynolds number was 43 and 68 respectively, matching that in blood flow of 1 Pa wall shear stress within the same model.</p>

<p>2.3.2 Image acquisition</p>
<p>Model vessels were placed onto the stage of an inverted microscope (AE2000 Motic), with a connected camera (Moticam 2300, Motic). A 4x objective lens was used to ensure the full diameter of the vessel was in view and a live image was displayed via Images Plus software (Motic). The vessel was oriented so that the leading edge of the stent was within the image, with flow moving horizontally from left to right. The bottommost stent struts were brought into focus, before light intensity, aperture diaphragm opening and camera exposure were adjusted until moving particles could be seen.</p>
<p>The camera software was used to record a 2 minute video. The vessel was then repositioned so that the field of view was moved downstream, with a small amount of overlap with the previous field. Another 2 minute video was recorded and the vessel repositioned again. This process was repeated until the downstream end of the stent was captured in a final field of view.</p>
<p>Once the procedure was complete, particle accumulation was recorded (see Section 2.3.5). Following this, the model was flushed, removed from the system and rinsed with acetone to dissolve and remove any remaining particles. The model was rotated by 90° to expose different stent geometry and reconnected to the pump with a fresh reservoir. The above process was then repeated.</p>

<p>Flow patterns and particle accumulation were visualised by tracking the motion of suspended particles through the model. As per the cell migration studies, the protocol detailed in this section was carried out for a variety of coronary and flow diverter stents, as well as empty non-stented vessels as controls. However, 1.5 mm diameter models were not included in this study.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>2.3.1 Set up</p>
<p>Vessels were connected to a fluid reservoir and peristaltic pump, as described in Section 2.2.5.1. Any models previously used with HUVEC were first cleaned of debris. Reservoirs were filled with 12 ml of room temperature 70% industrial methylated spirit (IMS). A suspension of 10 µm polystyrene particles (FluoSpheres, Fisher Scientific) with 3.6 x 106 particles/ml was agitated via vortex mixer (Lab Dancer S42, IKA). 40 µl of the suspension was then transferred to the reservoir at a 250:1 fluid to particle volume ratio.

The x-ray source was turned on and control software was opened to provide a live image via an 11 megapixel x-ray camera, as well as the means to alter scan parameters: voltage, current, resolution, the use of aluminium filters, etc.</p>
<p>The vertical position of the stage, the camera pixel size (large, 1000 x 500; medium, 2000 x 1000; small, 4000 x 2000) and the proximity of the camera to the sample were set to maximise resolution while ensuring that the region of interest (i.e. the full length of the stent or cast) remained within the field of view. When the sample extended beyond the widest field of view (typically models containing stents longer than 13 mm) multiple oversize scans were performed. The stage, being metallic, was always kept outside of the field of view to reduce interference.</p>
<p>The stage was set to rotate 180°, in 0.7° steps. Additional settings were varied, to optimise parameters for the type of sample being scanned (Table 2.1). Voltage determined the intensity of the x-ray beam, its penetration, and the contrast of the resultant image. Current determined the number of emitted x-ray photons and the brightness of the resultant image. Filters blocked low intensity x-rays when required, improving contrast and reducing noise.</p>
<p>The scan was started and as the stage rotated the camera captured an x-ray tomography projection image of the sample at each rotation step (Figure 2.6B).

Each country's colour reflects the average Implicit Association Test (IAT) score for that country using data from Harvard's Project Implicit. Overall we have scores for 288,076 White Europeans, collected between 2002 and 2015, with sample sizes for each country shown inset.<br><br>The IAT<br>The IAT is a measure of implicit racial attitudes. Because of the design of the test it is very difficult to deliberately control your score . Many people, including those who sincerely hold non-racist or even anti-racist beliefs, demonstrate positive implicit bias on the test. Scores on the test are not reliable, and so don't allow predictions of individuals' true implicit attitudes or behaviour. However, when many scores are collected together definite patterns emerge. The most striking of these is that the average score on the racial bias IAT is non-zero. Both in the US, where this measure was developed, across Europe (shown here for the first time), the test shows that people are slower to associate Blackness with positive words such as ""Good"" or ""Nice"" and faster to associate Blackness with negative concepts such as ""Bad"" or ""Evil"". <br><br>One idea is that implicit attitudes, such as measured by the IAT, reflect the automatic associations we hold in our minds, and that these develop over years of immersion in the social world. Although we, as individuals, may not hold racist beliefs, the ideas we associate with race may be constructed by a culture which describes people of different ethnicities in consistent ways, and ways which are consistently more or less positive. Looked at like this, the IAT - which is a weak measure of individual psychology - may be most useful if individuals' scores are aggregated to provide a reflection on the collective social world we inhabit.<br><br>The results shown in this map give detail to what we already expected - that across Europe racial attitudes are not neutral. Blackness has negative associations for White Europeans, and there are some interesting patterns in how the strength of these negative associations vary across the continent.<br><br><br><br>*open data, open tools*<br>This new map is possible because Project Implicit release their data via the Open Science Framework (<a href=""https://osf.io/52qxl/"">osf.io</a>). This site allows scientists to share the raw materials and data from their experiments, allowing anyone to check their working, or re-analyse the data (as we have done here). The data analysis and map were done in R, an open source statistical programming language, and we collaborated using github.com, a platform for software projects. Now the data and code to produce the map are shared on Figshare.com, a site which allows data and graphics to be given stable digital object indentifiers (DOIs) and so integrated into the scholarly literature like other publications. We believe that open tools and publishing methods like these are necessary to make science better and more reliable.<br><br>*Sample limitations*<br>The data comes from Europeans who visited the US Project Implicit website, which is in English. Language specific IAT data may be available in the near future. For now we can be certain that the sample reflects a subset of the European population which are more internet-savvy than typical, probably younger, and probably more cosmopolitan (both because they are both comfortable using a website in English, and from the sheer fact that they were interested in taking a test of implicit racism). These factors are likely to underweight the extent of implicit racism in each country.<br><br>This data reflects scores on just one IAT (the classic White-Black/Positive-Negative IAT). Other dimensions of social attitudes can be assessed by different IATs.

<p>The circular barplot serves as a 24 hour clock, where each bar represents how many plays were recorded in that hour of the day. The charts are then split into quarters for morning, afternoon, evening, and night, mimicking daylight and night sky. These were created as histograms and were made circular using coord_polar(). The x and y axes were then modified to create the hole in the center.</p>
<p>The visual is faceted to show three unique dataframes: my entire listening history for that timeframe, my listening history of Fall Out Boy, and my listening history of 100 gecs. These were chosen to dissect my listening behavior at particular moments in my life. </p>
<p>I listen to Fall Out Boy primarily while traveling to and from Phoenix, and I listen to 100 gecs mostly while studying or coding. With this, I was able to recognize some of my habits in my barplots; my listening of Fall Out Boy was highest at 4-5AM and 8PM, which is usually when I would take long commutes. My listening of 100 gecs was highest at 7PM and 2AM, indicative of my night-owl studying habits.</p>
<p>Because of this challenge, I learned to familiarize myself with new R packages, as well as how circular barplots can be created using R Studio. Overall, it was a lot of fun and I'm excited to continue working with music and listening data in the future!</p>

cells, contributes to the regeneration of the epithelium.  The recruitment of macrophages plays a central
role in the regenerative process.  The
mechanism that regulates macrophage recruitment in response to gastric injury
is largely unknown.  Here we tested the
hypothesis that<b> </b>Shh stimulates macrophage chemotaxis to the
injured epithelium and contributes to gastric regeneration.  A mouse model expressing a myeloid
cell-specific deletion of Smoothened (LysMcre/+;Smof/f) was generated using
transgenic mice bearing loxP sites flanking the Smo gene (Smo loxP) and mice
expressing a Cre recombinase transgene from the Lysozyme M locus
(LysMCre).  Acetic acid injury was
induced in the stomachs of both control and LysMcre/+;Smof/f (SmoKO) mice
and gastric epithelial regeneration and macrophage recruitment analyzed over a
period of 7 days post-injury. Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BM-Mø) were
collected from control and SmoKO mice. Human-derived gastric
organoid/macrophage co-cultures were established, and macrophage chemotaxis
measured.  Compared to control mice, SmoKO
animals exhibited inhibition of ulcer repair and normal epithelial
regeneration, that correlated with decreased macrophage infiltration at the
site of injury.  Bone
marrow chimera experiments using SmoKO donor cells showed that control chimera
mice transplanted with SmoKO bone marrow donor cells exhibited a loss of ulcer
repair, and transplantation of control bone marrow donor cells to SmoKO mice
rescued epithelial cell regeneration.  Histamine
stimulated Shh secretion in human organoid/macrophage co-cultures resulted in macrophage
migration toward the gastric epithelium, a response that was blocked with Smo inhibitor
Vismodegib.  Shh-induced macrophage
migration was mediated by AKT signaling.<b> </b>In conclusion, Shh signaling acts as a macrophage chemoattractant via a
Smo-dependent mechanism during gastric epithelial regeneration in response to
injury.<div><div><br></div><div><hr></div><div><br></div><div><i>For inquiries regarding the contents of this dataset, please contact the Corresponding Author listed in the README.txt file.

We examined a predator-prey interaction between native bees and their woodpecker predators that may be altered by the bees’ nest plant. In southeastern Arizona, carpenter bees build nests inside dried inflorescence stalks of plants such as sotol. Woodpeckers prey upon carpenter bee larvae inside these stalks, but sotol’s dense rosette of barbed leaves may protect larvae. We hypothesized that nests surrounded by leaves would be less accessible to woodpeckers, increasing predation on higher nests. This could drive nest placement. To test this hypothesis, we recorded locations of nests, rosettes, and predation.</div><div><div><br></div><div><hr></div><div><br></div><div><i>For inquiries regarding the contents of this dataset, please contact the Corresponding Author listed in the README.txt file.

I use aggregated human mobility data (how far people move each day) from Cuebiq, an offline intelligence and measurement marketing company, which partners with 86 apps to collect first-party location data. Different U.S. states have handled the Covid-19 Pandemic in vastly different ways, with some states still refraining from issuing stay-at-home orders. This has led to very different mobility behaviors by state. I show that the stay-at-home order successfully reduced movement during the week of March 23rd and April 13th, with Americans reverting towards pre-COVID-19 movement patterns in between.</div><div><br></div><div><div><div><br><hr></div><div><br></div><div><i>For inquiries regarding the contents of this dataset, please contact the Corresponding Author listed in the README.txt file.

The publishing of the Domestic Electrical Load (DEL) datasets was funded by the South African National Energy Development Initiative (SANEDI). Academic contributions have been led by Stellenbosch University and the University of Cape Town. Other collaborators and implementers include the Centre for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), eight SA municipalities, and consultants. As the largest and longest study of residential energy consumption in Southern Africa, the DEL data provides a unique insight into energy usage behaviour across a diverse demographic of households, spanning multiple climatic zones. The DEL data includes granular electricity meter readings taken at 5-minute intervals and household surveys that capture socioeconomic characteristics of metered households.<br></div></div>",False,"[{'id': 17004117, 'title': 'South African National Energy Development Initiative', 'grant_code': '', 'funder_name': None, 'is_user_defined': 1}]",False,,0,7,15

Our un-learning story is centred on the <a href=""https://vimeo.com/521716010"">Boon Wurrung Tree</a>, a culturally marked Tree that formed the impetus for <a href=""https://www.monash.edu/muma/exhibitions/previous/2022/tree-story/related-programs/tree-school"">The Tree School </a>installation and exhibition in Melbourne, Australia, as conceived by artists <a href=""https://www.monash.edu/muma/exhibitions/previous/2022/tree-story/related-programs/tree-school"">Sandi Halel and Alessandro Petti</a>. It was this Boon Wurrung Tree that connected our pre-service teachers together through partnership learning with primary school children and the Monash University Museum of Art (<a href=""https://www.monash.edu/muma/home"">MUMA</a>) and prompted learning across institutions. This Art-Reach experience saw us first come together to experience the Tree School exhibition at MUMA and then explore a Forest of Ideas workshop back at the Monash University studio where pre-service teachers facilitated the same children’s art experiences as inspired by cultural, sustainable and aesthetic knowledge about trees.</div>",False,"[{'id': 21418292, 'title': 'Supported by a VicHealth grant', 'grant_code': '', 'funder_name': None, 'is_user_defined': 1}]",False,10.26180/17193161,2,1,9

The simulation studies show that the strategy is robust against sensory noise, scalable to large swarm sizes, and generalizes to the problems of choosing between more than two options or between unequal options. The experiments—50 trials conducted with a group of 20 e-puck robots—show that the group achieves consensus in 96% of the trials.

In the present work, we address the shepherding problem, where the computation- and memory-free agents—the shepherds—are tasked to gather and move a group of dynamic agents—the sheep—towards a pre-defined goal. The shepherds and sheep are modelled as e-puck robots using computer simulations. Our findings show that the shepherding problem does not fundamentally require arithmetic computation or memory to be solved.

The novelty of our proposed solution is that it is applicable to extremely simple robots that lack run-time computation or storage. The solution requires only a single bit of information per robot—whether or not another robot is present in its line of sight. Computer simulations show that our deterministic controller, which was obtained through off-line optimization, achieves around 71–76% coverage in a test scenario with no robot redundancy, which corresponds to a 26–39% reduction of the area that is not covered, when compared to an optimized random walk. A moderately lower level of performance was observed in 20 experimental trials with 25 physical e-puck robots. Moreover, we demonstrate that the same controller can be used in environments of different dimensions and even to navigate a maze. The controller provides a baseline against which one can quantify the performance improvements that more advanced and expensive techniques may offer. Moreover, due to its simplicity, it could potentially be implemented on swarms of sub-millimeter-sized robots. This would pave the way for new applications in micro-medicine.</div>",False,[],False,0,2,2,7

maximum intensity projections at each time point. The Rvs167-GFP lifetime was
analyzed from those projections.<a></a> Movies and kymographs
were assembled using Fiji software. Images were
exported as TIFF files and image size adjusted to 300 d.p.i. and assembled

Developing a model that accounts for both factors will improve our understanding of the coagulation process. The work presented in this study details the development of a CFD model that considers the biochemical reactions between thrombin and fibrinogen, pulsatile blood flow, and clot growth within a three-dimensional patient-specific common femoral vein. Thrombin is released into the bloodstream from an injury zone on the wall of the vein. The Michaelis-Menten equation is used to represent the conversion of thrombin and fibrinogen to fibrin, the final product of the coagulation process. The model development began in a two-dimensional idealized geometry. At this stage, the model is used to conduct a parametric study to determine the effects of varying parameters such as inlet velocity, vein diameter, and peak thrombin concentration on the size and shape of the clot formed. Peak thrombin concentration is the key factor driving the initiation and propagation of clots in the vein. To demonstrate the potential use of the model, the two-dimensional model is then extended to an image-derived three-dimensional patient-specific geometry. Realistic clot growth was achieved using this model, and the clot was compared to a clot formed in vivo, demonstrating that with further development and refinement, this model could be used for patient-specific interventional planning.",False,[],False,0,0,0,7

<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has forced individuals to adopt online applications and technologies, as well as remote working patterns.  However, with changes in technology and working patterns, new  vulnerabilities are likely to arise. Cybersecurity threats have rapidly evolved to exploit uncertainty during the pandemic, and users need to apply careful judgment and vigilance to avoid becoming the victim of a  cyber-attack. This paper explores the factors that motivate security  behaviour, considering the current environmental uncertainty. An adapted  model, primarily based on the Protection Motivation Theory (PMT), is  proposed and evaluated using data collected from an online survey of 222  respondents from a Higher Education institution. Data analysis was  performed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling  (PLS-SEM). The results confirm the applicability of PMT in the security  context. Respondents’ behavioural intention, perceived threat  vulnerability, response cost, response efficacy, security habits, and  subjective norm predicted self-reported security behaviour. In contrast,  environmental uncertainty, attitude towards policy compliance,  self-efficacy and perceived threat severity did not significantly impact  behavioural intention. The results show that respondents were able to  cope with environmental uncertainty and maintain security behaviour.</p>",False,[],False,0,0,0,4

distribution of animals in a landscape depends mainly on the distribution of resources.
Resource availability is often facilitated by other species and can positively
influence local species diversity and affect community structure. Species that
significantly change resource availability are often termed, ecosystem
engineers. Identifying these species is important but predicting where they
have large or small impacts is a key challenge that will enhance the usefulness
of the ecosystem engineering concept. In harsh and stressful environments, the stress
gradient hypothesis predicts that community structure and function will be increasingly
influenced by facilitative interactions. To test this hypothesis, we investigate how
the ecosystem engineering role and importance of sociable weavers <i>Philetairus
socius</i> varies across a spatial gradient of harshness, for which aridity
served as a proxy. These birds build large colonies that are home to hundreds
of weavers and host a wide range of avian and non-avian heterospecifics. We
investigated the use of weaver colonies on multiple taxa (invertebrates,
reptiles, birds, and mammals) at multiple sites across a >1000 km aridity gradient.
We show that sociable weaver colonies create localized biodiversity hots-spots across
their range. Furthermore, trees containing sociable weaver colonies maintained localized
animal diversity at sites with lower rainfall, an effect not as pronounced at sites
with higher rainfall. Our results were consistent with predictions of the stress
gradient hypothesis, and we provide one of the first tests of this hypothesis in
terrestrial animal communities. Facilitation and amelioration by ecosystem engineers

based on the attraction to other species can be used as a defence strategy. This
attraction can provide valuable social information and protection benefits. Increased shared vigilance or cooperative mobbing can
come from small birds, while raptors may provide a protective umbrella against
brood parasites. The common redstart (<i>Phoenicurus phoenicurus</i>) is part of the migrant bird community and
is a regular host for the common cuckoo (<i>Cuculus

nest-boxes near to active nests of great tit (<i>Parus

monitored occupancy rates and followed
nest outcomes in terms of brood parasitism and nest predation risk, while
following other breeding factors that could be affected (e.g. breeding onset, reproductive
investment, and reproductive success). We found that redstarts avoided breeding near to goshawks, but they showed neither attraction nor avoidance
to breed next to great tits. Heterospecific
neighbours neither reduced brood parasitism risk nor affected overall nesting
success in redstarts. Thus, redstarts may not benefit from breeding near
heterospecifics. Other front-line strategies may be more important for
redstarts to prevent brood parasitism.  </p>",False,"[{'id': 21513146, 'title': 'DST-NRF Centre of Excellence of South Africa', 'grant_code': '', 'funder_name': None, 'is_user_defined': 1}, {'id': 21513149, 'title': 'Academy of Finland grant no. 12265', 'grant_code': '', 'funder_name': None, 'is_user_defined': 1}, {'id': 21513152, 'title': 'Academy of Finland grant no. 125720', 'grant_code': '', 'funder_name': None, 'is_user_defined': 1}, {'id': 21513155, 'title': 'Academy of Finland grant no. 138049', 'grant_code': '', 'funder_name': None, 'is_user_defined': 1}, {'id': 21513158, 'title': 'Kone Foundation', 'grant_code': '', 'funder_name': None, 'is_user_defined': 1}, {'id': 21513161, 'title': 'Kvantum Institute', 'grant_code': '', 'funder_name': None, 'is_user_defined': 1}, {'id': 21513164, 'title': 'Societas pro Fauna et Flora Fennica and Oskar Öflunds Stiftelse', 'grant_code': '', 'funder_name': None, 'is_user_defined': 1}]",False,0,0,0,6

The specimen is intended to deform in planar simple shear and is designed to be machined with a continuous annular shear zone. As a result, there are no “edge effects” or geometric discontinuities to generate instabilities, thus large true strains up to 1 can be achieved. Before this research, the specimen had only been used for material characterisation in the quasi-static regime. The aim of this research was to conduct further quasi-static testing using the in-plane torsion test and to extend its use into the dynamic regime. Quasi-static tests were performed on a quasi-static torsional (QST) system that was designed to be integrated onto a Zwick universal testing machine. Dynamic tests were performed on a modified torsional split Hopkinson bar</div><div>(TSHB) system. The TSHB system adopted a nested configuration which allowed for a longer incident bar, and thus larger obtainable strains. Two quick-release mechanisms were used, one using a novel reusable wedge and the other using fracture-pins. All specimens were manufactured from Al 1050 H14. Typical results agreed with material test data available in the literature. Both systems attained large strains at near-constant strain rates and together, allowed for material characterisation over a large range of strain rates. Near-uniform deformations were observed for specimens with lower strain gauge widths. An added feature of the specimen was the flat reverse face, which together with the nested configuration of both systems allows for the possibility for full-field DIC measurement in the future. An estimation method for steady-state flow stress is presented with the steady-state flow stress found to be rate dependant. Finally, a relationship between the steady-state flow stress and strain rate for all experimental results is proposed.</div>",False,[],False,0,0,0,5

Decoupling the effects of alteration on the mineralogy and flotation performance of Great Dyke PGE ores.<br></i></div><div><i><br></i></div><div><i>Abstract: Ores from the same deposit
may exhibit extensive variability in their mineralogy and texture. The ability
to quantify this variability while linking it to minerals processing performance
is one of the primary goals of process mineralogy. This study focuses on the
effect of alteration as a source of ore variability in three Great Dyke
platinum group element ore samples from Zimbabwe – two of which were more
pristine compared to the third that was locally classified as ‘oxidised’ ore.
These ores are known to be characterized by varying degrees of alteration
resulting in numerous challenges in flotation affecting both grade and recovery.
Alteration via near surface oxidation of the valuable base metal sulfides and
platinum group minerals resulted in lower flotation recoveries of Cu, Ni, Pt,
Pd. Evidence of incipient oxidation was more readily observed in the base metal
sulfide assemblage than the platinum group mineral assemblage, even though the
loss in recovery because of oxidation was most significant for Pd. The effect
of the alteration through hydration resulted in a significant increase in mass
pull and dilution of concentrate grade through the inadvertent recovery of
naturally floating gangue comprising composite orthopyroxene and talc
particles. In this study, the amount of naturally floating gangue was more
strongly correlated with the talc grain size distribution than the grade of
talc in the flotation feed. These oxidation and hydration alteration reactions
are not necessarily mutually exclusive although one may be more dominant than
the other giving rise to ore variability.</i><br></div><div>

programs have increasingly had to consider the value of reintroducing captive
animals into the wild. However, reintroductions often fail as captive
individuals may be naïve to predators and do not recognize or respond timeously
to predatory cues, contributing to high mortality rates soon after release.
This study evaluates differences in predator response behaviours between
individuals from captive, semi-wild (i.e., raised in captivity and successfully
released) and wild populations of cheetah (<i>Acinonyx
jubatus</i>) to an artificially simulated auditory threat of lions (<i>Panthera leo</i>), a larger, natural
predator in South Africa. Such comparisons improve our understanding of
differences between captive and wild behaviours and provide an aspect to evaluating
the relative success of soft-release programs. Changes in the proximal distance,
the latency of approach and hesitation toward both control (African bush
cricket) and treatment (lion) auditory cues were observed for 29 cheetah from
captive, semi-wild and wild populations in at least three trail replicates. Overall,
captive individuals consistently displayed poor predatory response behaviours,
approaching the treatment as often as the control, spending time near the stimulus
(<10m) and often hesitating. Whereas both semi-wild and wild individuals could
distinguish between the control and treatment, consistently fleeing from the
latter, with little hesitation. Repeatability analyses indicated that these behavioural
responses to predatory cues could not be explained by individual personality
and between-trial learning comparisons showed no evidence of habituation. Our findings
demonstrate how <i>a priori</i> testing for predator naïvety could inform
future introductory decisions and thereby increase post-release survival rates,
significantly improving the efficacy of reintroduction strategies. We, therefore,
emphasize the importance of such research and screening in highly threatened
species, such as cheetah, where reintroduction from captivity has become a
necessary consideration. </p>",False,"[{'id': 20209230, 'title': 'Ashia', 'grant_code': '', 'funder_name': None, 'is_user_defined': 1}]",False,0,0,0,6

Includes csv of aggregated homicide and aggravated assault data for 44 US cities; an R project file; an R script for reproducible cleaning process; an interrupted time series analytical file, which also produces plots; a meta-analysis file, which also produces forest plots; records of police involved shootings with links to news reports.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>To use:</strong></p>
<p>Download all into one folder and open the R project file with R using RStudio. I have tried to make these fully functional on their own to maximise reproducibility. You will likely need to download packages (but RStudio should prompt you to the ones that are missing). If you want to re-run the cleaning file, you will have to download the UCR and city crime data. I have provided links to these sources. Otherwise, everything should run out of the box!<br>
</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong></p>
<p>I do not own the original data files from cities and UCR. While I have not included these case-level data, they are all publicly available and I have provided links, aside from Tampa which I acquired through a data request. I am happy to assist any interested researchers with getting the source data.</p>

The current version of the historical data is referred to as VicClim5. Additionally, there are 32 levels of upper atmosphere weather variables including temperature, atmospheric moisture, wind and other common meteorological variables. </p>
<p>Finally, projected fire weather variables from twelve Global Climate Models were used to statistically downscale these outputs at 4km spatial resolution using the Victoria fire weather climatology as the historical base period. Together this provides a climatology and projected datasets for the period 1972 to 2100. See the two journal articles for details on the projected datasets (Clarke et al. 2022, Parts 1 and 2 attached).</p>
<p>Please see the metadata files, reports, and journal articles for the details of the construction and applicability of the data. </p>

For the vast majority of women (~80%) these tests were uninformative (ie negative). Continued research had identified additional breast cancer susceptibility genes and commercial and direct-to-the-public diagnostic testing facilities were including a larger number of genes in gene panel tests made possible via new, massively parallel sequencing technology. These tests posed considerable challenges to clinical genetics services as very little was known about the cancer risks associated with any of the observed genetic variation.</p><p>The community urgently needed the evidence from which to translate information about these new and putative breast cancer genes into clinical genetics services and to transition to routinely applying gene panel tests.</p><p>BRA-STRAP conducted a large nation-wide study of women at high-risk of breast cancer who had tested negative for pathogenic variants in <i>BRCA1</i> and <i>BRCA2</i>. BRA-STRAP designed a 24 gene panel test that included <i>ATM, BARD1, BRCA1, BRCA2, BRIP1, CDH1, CHEK2, FANCM, MLH1, MRE11A, MSH2, MSH6, MUTYH, NBN, NF1, PALB2, PMS2, PTEN, RAD50, RAD51C, RAD51D, RECQL, STK11 and TP53</i>. This work brought together data representing 30,000 Australian women of all ages across the cancer risk spectrum, affected and unaffected with breast cancer, and their families.  Contributing to BRA-STRAP are i) large research cohorts of aging populations and of women above population risk, and ii) the clinical genetics community and women found negative for <i>BRCA1</i> and <i>BRCA2</i> mutations following testing in an Australian Familial Cancer Centre over the last 2 decades. </p><p>The data enabled Australian population-specific estimates of penetrance and prevalence to be made for several new breast cancer genes that now support the best practice guidelines for genetic testing and risk management for PALB2, ATM and CHEK2 on eviQ (Cancer Treatments Online https://www.eviq.org.au).

<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>Biodiversity is facing a global extinction crisis that will reduce ecological trait diversity, evolutionary history, and ultimately ecosystem functioning and services. A key challenge is understanding how species losses will impact morphological and phylogenetic diversity at global scale. Here, we test whether the loss of species threatened with extinction according to the IUCN leads to morphological and phylogenetic homogenisation across both the whole avian class, and within each biome and ecoregion globally. We use a comprehensive set of continuous morphological traits extracted from museum collections of 8455 bird species, including geometric morphometric beak shape data,9 and sequentially remove species from those at most to least threat of extinction. We find evidence of morphological, but not phylogenetic, homogenisation across the avian class, with species becoming more alike in terms of their morphology. We find that most biome and ecoregions are expected to lose morphological diversity at a greater rate than predicted by species loss alone, with the most imperilled regions found in East Asia and the Himalayan uplands and foothills. Only a small proportion of assemblages are threatened with phylogenetic homogenisation, in particular parts of Indochina. Species extinctions will lead to a major loss of avian ecological strategies, but not a comparable loss of phylogenetic diversity. As the decline of species with unique traits and their replacement with more widespread generalist species continues, the protection of assemblages at most risk of morphological and phylogenetic homogenisation should be a key conservation priority. </p>",False,[],False,,5,0,7

The strongest event occurred in 2012 with a magnitude of MW 3.6. How faults slip during such small magnitude earthquakes (i.e., magnitude 3 – 4) is not clear, despite several recent studies. We conduct laboratory experiments to simulate the pulse-like (i.e. short but rapid) fault slip behavior characteristic for small magnitude human-induced seismicity, using a newly designed experimental set-up enabling  monitoring of the slip behavior under stress and displacement closer to conditions relevant to faults in Groningen.

The SATA-Drive: a robotic driver designed for the actuation of a 3mm scaled version of the SATA-LRS is presented.</p>
<p>Methods: A modular, expandable gear mechanism was designed to efficiently rotate and translate the instrument shafts. The 3mm SATA-LRS is controlled as proof. An user-experiment is conducted to test the (de)coupling of the instrument to and from the drive.</p>
<p>Results: A video shows the SATA-Driver successfully articulating, rotating and grasping the end-effector. End-effector exchange is possible in 29 (10) seconds, while complete instrument coupling requires 21 (6) seconds and de-coupling requires 16 (7) seconds.</p>
<p>Discussion: The drive has effectively transformed a non-surgical robot arm into a system similar to robot assisted laparoscopy. The modularity of the drive’s segmented build can easily be adapted and could benefit the adoption of future instruments. The SATA-LRS’s cleanability features and its end-effector changes without disassembly are expected to benefit medical robotics.

This paper presents a concept of eye-based maneuver control for AV-pedestrian interaction. Previously, it was unknown whether the AV should conduct a stopping maneuver when the driver looks at the pedestrian or looks away from the pedestrian. A two-agent experiment was conducted using two head-mounted displays with integrated eye-tracking. Seventeen pairs of participants (pedestrian and driver) each interacted in a road crossing scenario. The pedestrians’ task was to hold a button when they felt safe to cross the road, and the drivers’ task was to direct their gaze according to instructions. Participants completed three 16-trial blocks: (1) Baseline, in which the AV was pre-programmed to yield or not yield, (2) Look to Yield (LTY) in which the AV yielded when the driver looked at the pedestrian, and (3) Look Away to Yield (LATY) in which the AV yielded when the driver did not look at the pedestrian. The driver’s eye movements in the LTY and LATY conditions were visualized using a virtual light beam. A performance score was computed based on whether the pedestrian held the button when the AV yielded and released the button when the AV did not yield. Furthermore, the pedestrians’ and drivers’ acceptance of the mappings was measured through a questionnaire. The results showed that the LTY and LATY mappings yielded better crossing performance than Baseline. Furthermore, the LTY condition was best accepted by drivers and pedestrians. Eye-tracking analyses indicated that the LTY and LATY mappings attracted the pedestrian’s attention, but pedestrians adequately distributed their attention between the AV and a second vehicle approaching from the other direction. In conclusion, LTY control may be a promising means of AV control at intersections before full automation is technologically feasible. </p>",False,"[{'id': 19682240, 'title': 'This research is supported by grant 016.Vidi.178.047 (“How should automated vehicles communicate with other road users?”), which is financed by the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO).', 'grant_code': '', 'funder_name': None, 'is_user_defined': 1}]",False,10.1016/j.apergo.2022.103825,2,0,5

sustainability metrics, the implementation of changes to their energy 
profiles, and finally the substantive progress seen in their collective 
carbon footprint.<br><br>It was found that among the two initiatives, 
SBTi appears posed for larger emissions mitigation, while RE100 is 
better at promoting more effective renewable energy purchasing 
practices. However, direct emission reductions are mostly concentrated 
on a reduced number of firms in energy intensive sectors, with the 
remaining members focusing on reductions through indirect methods that 
might not be additional at the global level. Similarly, it was found 
that informational barriers remain high even in these firms, with a

<p>If you want to access all the data, including (raw) quantities that are not directly used to compute the results shown in the article, download <em>SimData.zip</em>. <em>SimData.zip</em> contains all data from individual .zip-files, combined for your convenience. Alternatively, you can download all individual .zip-files.</p>
<p>Within the .zip folders, the title of the data contains the simulation parameters it was obtained from. The data titles follow the following format (where the brackets [...] indicate variables):</p>
<p><em>[prefix]</em>-iter-<em>[parameter itermax]</em>-thetaI-<em>[parameter theta_I]</em>-m-<em>[parameter 100*m]</em>-alpha-<em>[parameter 100*alpha]</em>-thetab-<em>[parameter theta_b]</em>.npy</p>
<p>The variables are defined as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>[prefix]</em>: Quantity name, as in the .zip title (e.g. CRLBxI, CRLBxM).</li>
  <li><em>[parameter itermax]</em>: Parameter itermax, i.e. the amount of imeSMLM iterations, that was used in simulation.</li>
  <li><em>[parameter theta_I]</em>: Parameter theta_I, i.e. the expected signal photon intensity over all iterations under maximum illumination (photons), that was used in simulation.</li>
  <li><em>[parameter 100*m]</em>: Parameter m, i.e. the modulation contrast of the illumination patterns, that was used in simulation. Values were multiplied by 100 in the title only, to avoid commas in the title.</li>
  <li><em>[parameter 100*alpha]</em>: Parameter alpha, i.e. the aggressiveness parameter/the amount of standard deviations between the emitter estimate and a pattern minimum, that was used in simulation. Values were multiplied by 100 in the title only, to avoid commas in the title.</li>
  <li><em>[parameter theta_b]</em>: Parameter theta_b, i.e. the expected background photon count per pixel, assumed to be uniform over the region of interest (photons/pixel), that was used in simulation.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, the file <em>VTIx-iter-3-thetaI-2000-m-95-alpha-300-thetab-8.npy</em> contains the simulated VTI values of an imeSMLM experiment in the fixed photon budget scenario with 3 iterations, an expected photon budget of 2000 photons, a modulation contrast of 0.95, an aggressiveness parameter of 3 and an expected background of 8 photons/pixel.</p>

In addition to the typical peripheral limb motor symptoms, vocal motor issues such as deteriorated vocal quality are present in Parkinson's patients. Unfortunately, very little is known about the biological mechanisms underlying these vocal changes. Here, we developed a Parkinsonian model using the zebra finch songbird to study the underlying neural mechanisms of these changes. Finch song and supportive brain areas are similar to human speech and brain pathways. To do this, we recorded song for 2 hours from zebra finches injected with an adeno-associated virus expressing either the causally-related human Parkinsonian gene SNCA or control GFP protein in finch brain. Song was then segmented using a specially designed matlab program called Vocal Inventory Clustering Engine (VoICE) into unique syllables. Acoustic features such as duration, pitch, mean frequency, amplitude, Wiener Entropy, frequency modulation, and amplitude modulation were measured from 75 individual copies of these syllables. The mean, mean variance, and coefficient of variation of these syllables were also measured. Motif-level data was also collected to monitor how much each bird sang (i.e., how many copies of song were uttered over a 2 hour period). We found that overexpression of SNCA led to shorter and poorer quality syllables that are similar to Parkinsonian vocal changes.<div><br></div><div><div><br></div><div>To cite this work, please cite both the associated PLoS One paper ""<a href=""https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0265604"">Vocal changes in a zebra finch model of Parkinson’s Disease characterized by alpha-synuclein overexpression in the song-dedicated anterior forebrain pathway</a>"" and this dataset.</div><div><br></div><div><hr></div><div><i><br></i></div><div><i>For inquiries regarding the contents of this dataset, please contact the Corresponding Author listed in the README.txt file.

However, most studies of intermittent streams are conducted at extremes of scale, are limited in taxonomic and temporal scope, and focus exclusively on drying patterns. Here, we assessed how both flow intermittency and orientation to perennial refuges affect aquatic invertebrates and aquatic and semi-aquatic vertebrates across two years within two intermittent river basins differing in their aridity. We used loggers to characterize flow intermittency and wet-dry mapping to determine orientation to perennial refuge of reaches. In winter and summer 2015 and 2016, we collected and identified invertebrates and visually surveyed vertebrates. Using permutational multivariate analyses of variance with distance matrices, we found distinct invertebrate communities by basin, flow class (perennial or intermittent), and season, and distinct vertebrate communities by basin, and between flow classes and seasons in the more arid basin. Invertebrate communities had higher beta diversity in the more arid than mesic basin, whereas the opposite was true for vertebrates. We identified indicator species for all combinations of basin and flow class, perennial reaches combined from both basins, each basin, and some combinations of flow class and season within basins. Flow intermittency and orientation to perennial refuge predictors correlated well with both invertebrate and vertebrate communities. However, we did not find nestedness of communities that differed significantly from that expected by chance in response to increasing flow intermittency or distance to refuge. Lastly, basin, flow intermittency, and orientation to perennial refuge predictors were generally important for modeling taxon richness and densities, and richness and densities decreased with increasing flow intermittency and distance to perennial refuge.

However, most studies of intermittent streams are conducted at extremes of scale, are limited in taxonomic and temporal scope, and focus exclusively on drying patterns. Here, we assessed how both flow intermittency and orientation to perennial refuges affect aquatic invertebrates and aquatic and semi-aquatic vertebrates across two years within two intermittent river basins differing in their aridity. We used loggers to characterize flow intermittency and wet-dry mapping to determine orientation to perennial refuge of reaches. In winter and summer 2015 and 2016, we collected and identified invertebrates and visually surveyed vertebrates. Using permutational multivariate analyses of variance with distance matrices, we found distinct invertebrate communities by basin, flow class (perennial or intermittent), and season, and distinct vertebrate communities by basin, and between flow classes and seasons in the more arid basin. Invertebrate communities had higher beta diversity in the more arid than mesic basin, whereas the opposite was true for vertebrates. We identified indicator species for all combinations of basin and flow class, perennial reaches combined from both basins, each basin, and some combinations of flow class and season within basins. Flow intermittency and orientation to perennial refuge predictors correlated well with both invertebrate and vertebrate communities. However, we did not find nestedness of communities that differed significantly from that expected by chance in response to increasing flow intermittency or distance to refuge. Lastly, basin, flow intermittency, and orientation to perennial refuge predictors were generally important for modeling taxon richness and densities, and richness and densities decreased with increasing flow intermittency and distance to perennial refuge. Collectively, our data suggest that intermittent streams harbor unique biodiversity, but also that some taxa have context-dependent responses to intermittency and orientation to perennial refuges. These findings also suggest that future increases in stream drying are likely to lead to changes to stream communities with high potential for the loss of aquatic biodiversity.<br></div><div><p></p><div><div><br></div><div><hr></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><i>For inquiries regarding the contents of this dataset, please contact the Corresponding Author listed in the README.txt file.

We investigated how drought affects carbon and water fluxes in addition to soil-plant-atmosphere interactions by tracing <sup>13</sup>CO<sub>2</sub> and deep-water <sup>2</sup>H<sub>2</sub>O label pulses and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in an enclosed experimental rainforest. Ecosystem dynamics were driven by different plant functional group responses to drought. Drought- sensitive canopy trees dominated total fluxes but also exhibited the strongest response to topsoil drying. Although all canopy-forming trees had access to deep water, these reserves were spared until late in the drought. Belowground carbon transport was slowed, yet allocation of fresh carbon to VOCs remained high. Atmospheric VOC composition reflected increasing stress responses and dynamic soil-plant- atmosphere interactions, potentially affecting atmospheric chemistry and climate feedbacks. These interactions and distinct functional group strategies thus modulate drought impacts and ecosystem susceptibility to climate change. </div><div><br></div></div></div><div><div><hr></div><div><br></div><div><i>For inquiries regarding the contents of this dataset, please contact the Corresponding Author listed in the README.txt file.

Modeling long-term variability of Eurasian runoff to the Arctic Ocean is complicated by the considerable variability of river discharge in time and space, and the monitoring constraints imposed by a sparse gauged-flow network and paucity of satellite data. We quantify tree growth response to river discharge at the upper reaches of the Yenisei River in Tuva, South Siberia. Two regression models built from eight tree-ring width chronologies of <i>Larix sibirica </i>are applied to reconstruct winter (Nov–Apr) discharge for the period 1784-1997 (214 years), and annual (Oct–Sept) discharge for the period 1701–2000 (300 years). The Nov–Apr model explains 52% of the discharge variance whereas Oct–Sept explains 26% for the calibration intervals 1927–1997 and 1927-2000, respectively. This new hydrological archive doubles the length of the instrumental discharge record at the Kyzyl gauge and resets the temporal background of discharge variability back to 1784. The reconstruction finds a remarkable 80% upsurge in winter flow over the last 25 years, which is unprecedented in the last 214 years. In contrast, annual discharge fluctuated normally for this system, with only a 7% increase over the last 25 years. Water balance modeling with CRU data manifests a significant discrepancy between decadal variability of the gauged flow and climate data after 1960. We discuss the impact on the baseflow rate change of both the accelerating permafrost warming in the discontinuous zone of South Siberia and widespread forest fires. The winter discharge accounts for only one third of the annual flow, yet the persistent 25-year upsurge is alarming. This trend is likely caused by Arctic Amplification, which can be further magnified by increased winter flow delivering significantly more fresh water to the Kara Sea during the cold season.<br><br></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><i><br>For inquiries regarding the contents of this dataset, please contact the Corresponding Author listed in the README.txt file.

In System 2, we used a novel dual TILDAS analyzer for isotopomers of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (NO2), and Proton Transfer Reaction Time Of Flight Mass Spectrometers (PTR-TOF-MS) vocus (ARI, Billerica, MA, USA) for VOCs (more details: Summary systems experiment and figures.pdf).</p><p>This data set contains the processed data from the results obtained during the different experiments conducted using controlled columns filled with a simple silica matrix to optimize system parameters and obtain representative soil gas samples. It also contains processed data from experiments using real soil; we challenged the capability of the probe to measure changes in soil conditions by mimicking rainfall to rewet soil and by shifting soil redox from anaerobic to aerobic condition.</p><p>RStudio and R version 3.3.2 (R Studio Team, 2017) was used to combine raw data and metadata analysis from System 1. Igor Pro (version 7, WaveMetrics, Lake Oswego, OR) was used to analyze instrument diagnostic, concentrations and times series and graphics for both systems.</p><p>Igor Pro software was used under license. Igor Pro scripts were used for data processing and analysis including Aerodyne Research Inc. proprietary scripts for parsing and averaging data and cannot be in a public repository. Vocus data was processed using the Tofware (Aerodyne/TOFWERK A.G.) software package in Igor Pro. Other portions of Igor code used for plotting are available upon request. Raw measurements files (e.g., TILDAS and vocus spectra which are a large set of data) will be available upon request.</p><p>We are providing data in ASCII (tab delimited) organized in folders structured as PRO for processed data for specific experiments using System 1 and REA for ready-to-use data for graphic analysis (figures).

the science of phenology and facilitate ecosystem stewardship by providing phenological information
freely and openly. To accomplish these goals, the USA-NPN National Coordinating Office (NCO)
delivers observational data on plant and animal phenology in several formats, including minimally
processed status and intensity datasets and derived phenometrics for individual plants, sites, and
regions. This document describes the suite of observational data products delivered by the USA
National Phenology Network, covering the period 2009–present for the United States and accessible via
the <a href=""http://dx.doi.org/10.5066/F78S4N1V"">Phenology Observation Portal</a> and via an Application
Programming Interface. The data described here have been used in diverse research and management
applications, including over 30 publications in fields such as remote sensing, plant evolution, and
