# README

This folder contains scripts related to Figshare reporting and statistics

## Jupyter Notebooks:

CALL-STATS-ENDPOINTS.ipynb: example code to retreive statistics for articles in institutional repositories. This requires an API token. Retreiving information from figshare.com records does not require a key.

REPORTING-FROM-BATCH-DOWNLOAD.ipynb: A script to process and summarize the metadata csv that is created by the administrator batch management tool. This is only useful for administrators who can access the tool. It pulls out useful reporting information and also gathers views and downloads for the items in the spreadsheet.
