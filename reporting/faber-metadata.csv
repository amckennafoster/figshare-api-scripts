<p>The plot of all stars within 25 parsecs was created from the RECONS 
25 pc sample as it existed in January, 2012. Stars are colored by V-K 
color, and sized by how far from a rough main sequence they are (the 
giants are, in fact, giant).  These plots were made with a custom IDL 3D
 plotter.</p>
<p>The young stars plots are stars in known nearby young associations 
(less than 100 Myr old) from Zuckerman & Song (2004,2011), Torres et
 al. (2006,2008), Lopez-Santiago et al. (2006), Malo et al. (2013), 
Shkolnik et al. (2009, 2012), Rodriguez et al. (2011,2013), Riedel et 
al. (2011,2014), and many other sources.  Items are colored as follows:</p>

<p>The flickering gray points are all stars with known parallaxes, to 
better demonstrate the relative density of field stars on the same 
scale.  Because only measured trigonometric parallaxes have been used, 
there are many more objects in both sets than are displayed here.  The 
flickering seems to be an artifact of Matplotlib 1.3's plotting 
routines.</p></div>",[],"[""http://www.bdnyc.org"", ""http://www.recons.org""]",https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,10.5072/FK2.stagefigshare.5738359,,,0,,,0,[],[],,,0,,3/24/2017,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,

report a method, based on the combination of bimetallic nanodot arrays
and electrochemical bias, to allow for plasmonic modulation. Importantly,
our approach permits real-time light manipulation readily matchable
