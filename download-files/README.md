## Download files for a list of item/article/record ids
This script takes a list of article ids your account owns and downloads the files for each.

It can be modified to download files for public records

The script will create JSON and CSV versions for each item's record metadata and separately for a subset of file metadata.

You can choose to download the files to a folder called 'files' or to individual folders named for the item id.
