# README

This folder contains scripts to summarize items for a personal account. It is relevant to Figshare user accounts as well as administrators who want to retreive statistics for an account they manage.

## Jupyter Notebooks:

ACCOUNT-ITEMS-COLLECTION.ipynb: Create a list of items and Collections owned by an account with views and downloads.

ACCOUNT-ITEMS-COLLECTIONS-BY-SEARCH.ipynb: Rather than depending on having a token from an account to gather relevant items, use search to collect items with an author that match the search name.
